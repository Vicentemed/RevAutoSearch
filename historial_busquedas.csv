"PubMed","Effect of lidocaine ice button topical anesthesia on pain during maxillary buccal infiltration in 6-10-year children - A randomized control trial.","2025 Apr 1","BACKGROUND: Anxiety in children prior to general anaesthesia is common, with up 
to half displaying distress. Anxiety and distress may lead to unsuccessful 
anaesthesia, together with greater postoperative pain, agitation and behavioural 
changes after surgery including sleep disturbances. Midazolam is the current 
standard premedication; however, it has adverse effects such as the potential 
for respiratory suppression and unpredictable effects which may result in 
agitation rather than anxiolysis. Melatonin is an alternative preoperative 
anxiolytic; however, previous trials have delivered conflicting results. The aim 
of this non-inferiority trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin 
compared to midazolam in reducing anxiety in children undergoing general 
anaesthesia.
METHODS: We undertook a randomised-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, 
non-inferiority trial in 20 United Kingdom National Health Service trusts, with 
an embedded qualitative study and health economic evaluation. Anxious children 
having day case elective surgery under general anaesthesia were randomly 
assigned to either control (standard of care) group: midazolam; or intervention 
group: melatonin. The primary outcome was preoperative distress (non-inferiority 
hypothesis) as assessed by modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale Short Form. 
Secondary outcomes included safety and efficacy objectives. Analyses were by 
intention to treat, with an additional per-protocol analysis. The sample size of 
the trial was 624 children.
RESULTS: The trial was stopped early due to recruitment futility. Between 30 
July 2019 and 9 November 2022, 110 children were recruited; 55 allocated to 
midazolam and 55 allocated to melatonin. Pre-planned analyses showed an adjusted 
mean difference of 13.1 (95% confidence interval 3.7 to 22.4) for the 
intention-to-treat population and 12.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 22.6) for 
the per-protocol population, in favour of midazolam. In both analyses, the upper 
limit of the 95% confidence interval exceeds the predefined margin of 4.3; 
therefore, melatonin is not non-inferior to midazolam. The lower limit of the 
95% confidence intervals excludes zero and thus melatonin is inferior to 
midazolam; the difference found is considered to be clinically meaningful. 
Adverse events in the midazolam arm (26%) were slightly higher than melatonin 
(18%); there were no serious adverse events in either arm. Challenges to 
recruitment included study-related factors (eligibility criteria and trial 
design), participant factors (caregiver stress on the day of treatment) and 
practitioner factors (valuing predictability). In terms of acceptability, 
preferences of the anaesthetist, patient and caregiver factors and medication 
side effects profile were influential and suggest the choice of preoperative 
anxiolytic is more complex than previously described. On average, costs over the 
14 days post surgery were lower for those who received melatonin (-£46.20, 95% 
confidence interval -£166.14 to £66.74) with a mean incremental difference in 
procedure success of -0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.08 to 0.004), although 
there was uncertainty around the results.
CONCLUSION: In children with preoperative anxiety, midazolam is more effective 
than melatonin at reducing preoperative anxiety prior to general anaesthesia, 
although the early termination of the trial increases the likelihood of bias.
LIMITATIONS: The trial was prematurely terminated due to recruitment futility. 
Despite this, a clinically meaningful and statistically significant finding was 
observed about the primary outcome.
FUTURE WORK: There remains a need to develop or repurpose another drug with a 
more favourable side effects profile to midazolam.

"PubMed","Treatment of deciduous teeth in children using the Er:YAG laser compared to the traditional method: A randomized clinical trial.","2025 Jul-Aug","Plain Language Summary: The hospital anaesthetic room can be a worrying place 
for a child. Reducing a child’s distress can lead to better outcomes, including 
improved recovery from general anaesthesia, avoidance of delays or rescheduling 
of surgery and reduction in pain. Children with high levels of anxiety are given 
a calming medicine or ‘premedication’ prior to their general anaesthesia. In the 
United Kingdom, the most used medicine is ‘midazolam’, which is effective, but 
has side effects including breathing problems, feeling wobbly and unpredictable 
reduction in anxiety. Another calming medicine, ‘melatonin’, has shown promise, 
as it avoids midazolam’s side effects. It is a natural hormone produced in the 
human body, which causes sleepiness. The trial compared melatonin with midazolam 
in anxious children undergoing general anaesthesia for routine surgery across 20 
United Kingdom hospitals. Children who fitted the study criteria were consented 
and ‘randomised’ to receive midazolam or melatonin. Neither the children, their 
parents, nor their care staff knew which medicine they got. We looked at the 
level of the children’s anxiety from the time of entering the hospital until 
being given the anaesthetic, to see if there was a difference between how good 
the two medicines were at calming, as well as comparing costs, side effects and 
other measurements. We followed up the children 2 weeks later and interviewed 
some hospital staff, parents and children about their views. The trial was 
stopped early as it could not recruit enough participants. As with many studies, 
the COVID pandemic had a large impact on recruitment, and so the results of our 
study are not as definitive as we originally intended. However, we found that 
midazolam was better than melatonin at reducing anxiety in anxious children 
prior to their general anaesthesia. We also learnt what factors influence the 
choice of calming medicines and how we can better design future trials in 
similar groups. No significant differences in side effects were seen between the 
two medicines. There was uncertainty in the results of the cost-effectiveness 
analysis, though melatonin was found to be slightly cheaper (£46.20) than 
midazolam. While midazolam is more effective at calming children than melatonin, 
alternative medicines with fewer side effects need to be explored as 
premedications.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:26:00.184935"

where it seeks to enhance patient comfort and treatment outcomes, and provide 
distraction through creating an immersive environment.
AIM: To assess VR's impact on anxiety in children (6-12 years) during dental 
treatments with local anesthesia.
DESIGN: In this clinical trial, we assessed anxiety levels in children 
(6-12 years) undergoing local anesthetic dental procedures using VR animation. 
Initially, we utilized the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED) 
questionnaire for patient selection, in which 44 children were recruited, but 
eight were excluded, leaving 36 participants who were randomly assigned to 
either a VR group or a control group with no VR (18 participants each). Anxiety 
was measured using the MCDAS(f) questionnaire, along with heart rate and oxygen 
saturation.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that VR significantly reduced anxiety, as 
reflected in lower MCDAS(f) scores. Moreover, heart rate reductions were notably 
greater in the VR group compared to the control group (p < 0.001 for both 
measures), indicating a clear decrease in anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: VR shows promise for reducing dental anxiety and improving 
treatment outcomes, though additional research is needed to assess its long-term 
effects. The incorporation of VR in routine pediatric dental care may improve 
child cooperation and reduce reliance on pharmacological sedation.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:26:00.184935"

"PubMed","Nasopharyngeal airway-assisted sedation enhances oxygenation and reduces perioperative adverse events in pediatric dental surgery: A comparative clinical study.","2025 May 30","BACKGROUND: Dental fear and anxiety can significantly hinder the treatment of 
children. The aim of this research is to compare the effect of puppet play 
therapy (PPT) and tell-show-do (TSD) behavior guidance technique on child's 
behavior and anxiety in emergency dental clinics during local anesthesia (LA) 
administration.
METHODS: This randomized clinical trial included 50 children aged 3-6 years in 
need of emergency dental treatment under LA. The subjects were randomized into 2 
equal groups: the PPT group, where behavior management was provided using PPT, 
and the TSD group where TSD was used as the behavior guidance technique. Dental 
anxiety levels were evaluated using the Facial Index Scale (FIS) and Venham 
Anxiety Rating Scale. Pulse rates were measured before, during and after 
anesthesia administration. Patient behavior was also scored using the Frankl 
Behavior Rating Scale and Venham Behavior Rating Scale. The Face, Legs, 
Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale was used to assess pain.
RESULTS: The mean heart rates were lower for patients who received PPT 
(94.12 ± 15.71; 106.88 ± 12.67 and 103.16 ± 13.6) compared to TSD 
(103.4 ± 20.94, 112.5 ± 23.17 and 111.48 ± 25.07) before, during and after the 
LA, respectively. Anxiety levels measured by FIS were significantly reduced 
using PPT (p < 0.001) compared to TSD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a behavior modification method demonstrating 
efficacy in reducing anxiety among young children who had no previous dental 
exposure and underwent immediate invasive dental procedures, utilizing puppet 
play therapy.

in dental anxiety in children. Various techniques have been tried to minimize 
this discomfort such as topical anesthetic gel, spray, Vibration of tissue, and 
distraction techniques. Literature has shown lesser evidence for 
photobiomodulation (PBM) in pain reduction for pediatric patients.
AIM: To compare the efficacy of PBM 810 nm versus topical local anesthetic spray 
in reducing injection pain in children of age 6-12 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four children aged 6-12 years who visited the 
outpatient department, department of pediatric and preventive dentistry, 
requiring local anesthetic administration during invasive procedures were 
randomly allocated into three groups, namely Group 1 - topical spray (lignocaine 
hydrochloride 2%), Group 2 - PBM (810 nm, 0.6 W, 40 s), and Group 3 - PBM (810 
nm, 0.6 W, 3 min). Pain was assessed subjectively and objectively using the 
Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBS) and Sound-Eye-Motor (SEM) Scale, 
respectively. Objective and subjective pain scores were evaluated using One way 
ANOVA and jaw wise comparison of PBM efficacy done using independent t-test.
RESULTS: The mean WBS scores for Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 were 3.8 ± 2.21, 
1.77 ± 2.81, and 4.11 ± 3.1, respectively, and the difference was statistically 
significant (P = 0.025) between Group 1 (control) and Group 2 (PBM 40 s). 
However, no significant difference was found in considering SEM scores. 
Irrespective of bone topography, PBM was effective in reduction of injection 
pain, though it was not significant during local infiltration.
CONCLUSION: PBM with 810 nm laser, 0.6 W for 40 s is more effective in reducing 
the injection pain compared to topical anesthetic spray and PBM for 3 min.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:26:00.184935"

administration would be a key to a successful and painless dental procedure. 
Precooling (PC) has emerged as pain control tool in dentistry.
AIMS: This study aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy of lidocaine Ice 
button and lidocaine gel as topical anesthesia during maxillary buccal 
infiltration in children.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Randomized crossover trial, department of pediatric and 
preventive dentistry.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty children [60 local anesthesia (LA) injections] aged 
6-10 years requiring bilateral maxillary buccal infiltration for dental 
procedure, divided into 2 groups with equal distribution for this split-mouth 
study. The study group was lidocaine ice button topical anesthesia; the control 
group was the lidocaine gel group. Subjective pain was evaluated using 
Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, objective pain evaluation was done using 
Sound Eye and Motor (SEM) scale. Anxiety assessment using Venham picture test 
(VPT) and physiologic parameters such as SpO2 and Heart rate were evaluated 
before, during, and after administration of LA. Acceptance of lidocaine ice 
button was evaluated using a customized validated questionnaire.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data recorded in Microsoft Excel 365 and subjected to 
statistical analysis using Statistical Product and service solution SPSS version 
21.0 with P value considered statistically significant at < 0.05.
RESULTS: A significant reduction in pain on injection for both objective and 
subjective evaluations in the Lidocaine Ice Button group, as topical anesthesia 
was seen (P < 0.00011) Majority of the children preferred the use of Lidocaine 
ice button as a topical anesthetic. No difference in pain was observed in groups 
based on treatment sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: Less pain on injection was observed, proving the efficacy of 
lidocaine ice button as topical anesthesia for maxillary infiltration in the 
study. Lidocaine ice button was well accepted by the children as topical 
anesthesia.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:26:00.184935"

treatment of dental caries in deciduous teeth, in comparison to traditional 
methods.
OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine the most optimal erbium-doped 
yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser settings for carious lesions in deciduous 
teeth on different surfaces with the evaluation of treatment time and pain level 
on a visual analog scale (VAS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The randomized clinical trial involved 66 teeth with deep 
caries in 33 children aged 3-8 years, divided into 2 study groups: Er:YAG laser 
(test group); and conventional treatment with a dental turbine (control group). 
The time required for caries removal and cavity preparation using both methods 
was recorded. The inclusion criteria encompassed generally healthy pediatric 
patients, pain-free subjects, first-time dental appointment, and unicuspid 
primary teeth with caries. Dental caries treatment was performed without the 
administration of local anesthesia.
RESULTS: The cavity preparation time was on average 2.5 times longer when the 
Er:YAG laser was used compared to the conventional method. The study 
demonstrated the effectiveness of the Er:YAG laser in hard tissue preparation of 
deciduous teeth with a pulse energy of 230 mJ for enamel preparation, mainly on 
occlusal and proximal surfaces, and with a pulse energy of 120 mJ and 150 mJ for 
dentin preparation. Optimum operating frequencies were 10 Hz and 20 Hz with 
corresponding water consumption. The level of discomfort among the laser-treated 
patients indicated 0 based on VAS, meaning no pain. Among patients treated with 
the traditional method, the pain level averaged 5.27.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Er:YAG laser offers substantial advancements in 
comparison to traditional treatment with dental turbines by enhancing the 
overall comfort during caries therapy in children. It fosters better patient 
cooperation and reduces the need for intraoperative anesthetics due to its 
minimally invasive nature and the fact that it is a relatively quiet operation. 
This approach minimizes anxiety and discomfort often associated with dental 
procedures, making them more amenable to children.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:26:00.184935"

pressure, can occur during tracheal intubation and is an adverse event to be 
avoided. The aim of this study was to use a network meta-analysis (NMA) to 
develop a ranking of hemodynamic responses (HR and mean blood pressure, MBP) 
after intubation of indirect and direct laryngoscopes in pediatric patients. 
Method: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had a prospective randomized 
design, compared hemodynamic response (HR and MBP) to tracheal intubation 
between indirect and/or direct laryngoscopes, and were conducted in pediatric 
patients. The pooled difference between each intubation device's intubation time 
is expressed as a weighted mean difference (WMD) of a 95% confidence interval 
(CI). The intubation time of the device was evaluated using P-scores calculated 
from the network point estimates and standard errors. A random-effects model was 
used when pooling effect sizes. We also analyzed intubation time as a related 
factor to hemodynamic responses. Results: From the electronic databases, we 
selected 16 trials for review. In a Macintosh-referenced analysis, Airtraq 
suppressed an increase of HR and MBP during tracheal intubation in pediatric 
patients significantly more than a Macintosh laryngoscope. (HR; WMD = -16.7, 
95%CI -22.5 to -10.9, MBP; WMD = -8.57, 95%CI -10.9 to -6.27). Airtraq also 
topped the HR and MBP P-score rankings. The results of this study showed similar 
laryngoscopes in the top five rankings of P-scores (Airtraq, Coopdech video 
laryngoscope, Miller, C-MAC, Wis-Hipple) for HR and intubation time. 
Conclusions: We applied a network meta-analysis to create a consistent ranking 
of intubation devices that prevent hemodynamic changes during tracheal 
intubation in pediatric patients. In this NMA, Airtraq proved to be the best 
laryngoscope for preventing hemodynamic responses during tracheal intubation in 
pediatric patients. In the analysis of intubation time, Airtraq showed the 
shortest intubation time.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:26:00.184935"

It is characterized by a high rate of recurrence and locally aggressive enlargement. This condition often leads to facial asymmetry and difficulty in airway management during surgical excision. Due to its rarity, there are no established guidelines for the perioperative management of MNTI. We describe the successful airway and anaesthetic management of three paediatric cases of MNTI. These cases highlight the complexities of airway management in paediatric patients with limited oral space and facial asymmetry. The anaesthetic approach prioritized meticulous preparation for potential difficult airway scenarios, including obtaining high-risk consent, assembling appropriate equipment, and premedication with ketamine and glycopyrrolate. Inhalational induction with sevoflurane was employed, and video laryngoscopy was used to aid intubation. Muscle relaxation and analgesia were carefully managed intraoperatively, with an emphasis on minimizing opioid usage postoperatively. The cases illustrate the importance of teamwork and multidisciplinary collaboration in managing challenging paediatric airway scenarios. This series contributes to the understanding of anaesthetic considerations in MNTI cases and underscores the significance of thorough preparation and coordination in optimizing patient outcomes.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

A 23-item web-based survey was conducted. The first part collected demographic data, while the second included 16 multiple-choice questions based on clinical scenarios involving pulpal treatment of mandibular primary molars. Participants indicated their primary and alternative anaesthesia choices. Data were analyzed using SPSS v25.0 (p < 0.05). A total of 330 paediatric dentists participated (mean age: 30.64 ± 5.01 years; 90% female). Anaesthesia preferences varied significantly by age, tooth position, and treatment type (p < 0.05). For pulpectomy in first primary molars, buccal infiltration was preferred in 4-year-olds (53.4%), whereas inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) was more common in 7-year-olds (60.1%, p = 0.002). In second molars, IANB was commonly preferred in both age groups, with significantly higher use in older children (p = 0.001). In pulpotomy procedures, buccal infiltration anaesthesia (BI) was mainly used in 4-year-olds (62.8% for first molars; 37.6% for second molars), while IANB was preferred in 7-year-olds (56.3% and 70.7%, p = 0.004 and p < 0.001). When the initial anaesthesia failed, intrapulpal (IPA) and intraligamentary anaesthesia (ILA) were the most common alternatives. Paediatric dentists' anaesthesia preferences are influenced by patient age, tooth position, and treatment type. The study reflects the importance of adapting anaesthesia techniques to clinical conditions and patient needs.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Is Digital Anesthesia a Viable Alternative for Pain and Anxiety Control in Pediatric Dentistry?","2025","Pain and anxiety during dental procedures remain major challenges in pediatric dentistry, particularly during local anesthesia administration. This study compared the effectiveness of digital anesthesia systems versus conventional infiltration and mandibular block techniques in managing pain, anxiety, and behavioral responses in pediatric dental patients. Seventy-nine children aged 6-12 were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia via digital anesthesia system (DAS), infiltration, or mandibular block. Pain was assessed using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFRPS), anxiety via the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDAS), and behavioral responses through the FLACC scale. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and chi-square tests (p < 0.05). Children in the DAS group reported significantly lower pain scores during needle insertion, anesthetic delivery, and treatment. Post-treatment MCDAS scores decreased significantly in the DAS group, especially for items related to ""tooth examination,"" ""filling,"" and ""gingival injection."" FLACC results also indicated more favorable behavioral responses-such as relaxed facial expressions and absence of crying-in the digital group (p < 0.05). Digital anesthesia appears to be a highly effective alternative to conventional techniques for minimizing pain, reducing dental anxiety, and improving behavioral cooperation in pediatric patients, supporting its broader implementation in clinical practice.

"PubMed","Global, regional, and national sepsis incidence and mortality, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis.","2025","The global burden of sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated host response to infection leading to organ dysfunction, remains challenging to quantify. We aimed to comprehensively estimate the global, regional, and national burden of sepsis, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and underlying causes of sepsis-related deaths with co-occurring infectious syndromes. We used multiple cause-of-death, hospital, minimally invasive tissue sampling, and linked death certificate and hospital record data representing 149 million deaths, covering 4290 location-years with mortality estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to capture explicit and implicit sepsis cases and deaths. We estimated age-location-sex-specific fractions of sepsis-related deaths from 195 underlying causes of death and 22 infectious syndromes from 1990 to 2021 using binomial logistic regression models, and estimated sepsis-related deaths using GBD cause-specific mortality estimates. Using 250 million hospital admissions and 7·82 million deaths from hospital data, representing 1310 location-years, we modelled case fatality rates by use of binomial logistic regression, applied to sepsis death estimates to estimate sepsis incidence by age, location, and year. In 2021, we estimated 166 million (95% uncertainty interval 135-201) sepsis cases and 21·4 million (20·3-22·5) all-cause sepsis-related deaths globally, representing 31·5% of total global deaths. Sepsis-related deaths decreased between 1990 and 2019, followed by a surge in 2020 and 2021. As of 2021, individuals aged 15 years and older experienced increases across incidence (230%) and mortality (26·3%) since 1990. Those aged 70 years and older had the highest sepsis-related mortality in 2021 (9·28 million [8·74-9·86] deaths). Sepsis-related deaths from infectious underlying causes decreased from 11·8 million (11·1-12·5) in 1990 to 8·34 million (7·72-9·01) in 2019, then increased by 86·4% to 15·5 million (14·7-16·4) in 2021. Sepsis-related mortality due to non-infectious underlying causes of death increased from 4·69 million (4·35-5·05) in 1990 to 5·81 million (5·40-6·25) in 2021; the leading non-infectious underlying causes of death with sepsis were stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cirrhosis. In 2021, bloodstream infections inclusive of HIV and malaria (3·08 million [2·83-3·35]) and lower respiratory infections inclusive of COVID-19 (11·33 million [1·20-1·47]) were the most prominent infectious syndromes complicating sepsis-related deaths from non-infectious underlying causes, representing a consistent trend since 1990. The global burden of sepsis increased in 2020 and 2021, reversing progress from 1990. Sepsis incidence and mortality increased in people aged 15 years and older, especially those aged 70 years and older, and as a complication of non-infectious underlying causes of death such as stroke, primarily through bloodstream infections and lower respiratory infections. The global burden of sepsis is substantial, and sepsis is increasingly a complication of non-infectious causes of death.

In this clinical study, 48 healthy children requiring invasive dental treatment were divided into two groups: the mobile dental app group (group I) and the kaleidoscope group (group II). Group I used the ""Little Lovely Dentist"" app before receiving LA, while group II viewed various designs through a kaleidoscope prior to anesthesia administration. Anxiety levels were assessed using physiological measures [pulse rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rate] and subjective measures [facial image scale and Wong-Baker faces pain rating scale (WBFPS)] at preoperative and postoperative time points. The kaleidoscope group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all measured parameters compared to the dental app group postintervention (p = 0.000). Group II exhibited decreased pulse and respiratory rates, increased SpO2, and reduced pain scores, while group I showed slight increases in pain scores and significant increases in respiratory and pulse rates.

Local anesthesia is essential for pain control, but the injection process often causes fear and anxiety in children. Topical anesthetics are used to alleviate injection-associated pain; however, conventional anesthetics lack sufficient adhesion and efficacy. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of a novel articaine mucoadhesive (AMA) patch formulated with 4% articaine for pain control during local anesthetic injections (inferior alveolar nerve block) and subgingival tooth preparation for stainless steel crown (SSC) placement. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study design (CDCRI/DEAN/ETHICSCOMMITTEE/PEDO/PG-02/2024). The study was conducted with 60 children aged 6-12 divided into two groups: local anesthetic site (inferior alveolar nerve block) and tooth preparation for SSC. Each group was further divided into subgroups that received either the articaine or placebo patches. Pain responses were assessed using sound-eye-motor (SEM) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. A significance level of 5% was used for the analysis. Shapiro-Wilk and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess the data. The AMA patch significantly reduced pain compared to the placebo (p = 0.001). The SEM and VAS scores for the articaine patch were 1.236 and 2.102 (local anesthetic site), and 1.547 and 2.477 (tooth preparation for SSC), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups (p > 0.7). The AMA patch demonstrated effective pain reduction during local anesthetic injection and tooth preparation, offering promising results for pediatric pain management, with enhanced compliance and localized effects.

"PubMed","Evaluating the impact of camouflaged and insulin syringes with and without counter-stimulation on anxiety and behavior in children during administration of local anesthesia.","2025","Fear of injections and dental anxiety are the major barriers to successful pediatric dental treatment. Visual threats associated with conventional syringes can increase anxiety and pain perception in children, necessitating the use of child-friendly strategies. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the impact of camouflaged and insulin syringes, with and without counter-stimulation, on anxiety levels, pain perception, and behavioral responses during local anesthesia administration in children. A clinical trial involving 120 children aged 8-10 years who required bilateral maxillary local anesthesia was performed. Local anesthesia with camouflaged and insulin syringes was administered to each child once with and without thumb pressure counter-stimulation. Anxiety was measured using pulse rates, pain was measured using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, and behavior was measured using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale. Statistical analyses were performed using the independent t-test and chi-square test. Both groups were demographically comparable with no significant differences in age (independent t-test, P = 0.539) or sex distribution (chi-square test, P = 0.854). At first appointment, camouflaged syringes showed significantly lower pain scores (3.58 ± 0.74 vs. 4.17 ± 1.37; P = 0.005), lower pulse rates (89.10 ± 5.84 vs. 99.00 ± 1.80 bpm; P < 0.001), and better behavioral responses (FLACC score: 2.27 ± 0.78 vs. 2.80 ± 0.68; P < 0.001) compared with insulin syringes, as assessed by the independent t-test. These effects were further enhanced by counter-stimulation. At second appointment, although overall scores improved in both groups, post-treatment differences between the syringe types were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Camouflaged syringes combined with counter stimulation represent an effective, simple, and non-pharmacological method for reducing anxiety and improving cooperation during local anesthesia administration in pediatric dental patients. However, the findings are limited by the use of a homogenous sample of healthy, cooperative children aged 8-10 years and potential bias due to the inability of blind operators or participants. Future studies should evaluate a broader population and incorporate blind assessment protocols.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

Fifty-two healthy children aged 6-12 years requiring LA were randomly allocated into two treatment groups: those receiving the HEM-DT, and those receiving the CPV-T. Anxiety was assessed subjectively using the Animated Emoji Scale before and after the intervention, while pulse rate was recorded using a pulse oximeter before, during, and after LA. Pain perception was measured during LA using the Sounds, Eyes, Motor (SEM) scale and after LA using the colored analog scale. Physiological data were analyzed using independent t-tests for intergroup comparisons, and paired t-tests with repeated-measures ANOVA for intragroup analysis. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate intragroup anxiety scores, and Mann-Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparisons of anxiety and pain scores. Intragroup comparisons revealed statistically significant differences in pulse rates before, during, and after LA (P < 0.001). Intergroup comparisons also showed statistically significant differences in pulse rates during and after LA. Anxiety scores decreased significantly in the HEM-DT group (P < 0.001), which also had lower mean SEM and colored analogue scale pain scores than the CPV-T group (P < 0.001).

"PubMed","Global burden of 292 causes of death in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","2025","Timely and comprehensive analyses of causes of death stratified by age, sex, and location are essential for shaping effective health policies aimed at reducing global mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations. GBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55 761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46·8 years (95% UI 46·6-47·0) in 1990 to 63·4 years (63·1-63·7) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45·4 years (45·1-45·7) to 61·2 years (60·7-61·6), and for females it increased from 48·5 years (48·1-48·8) to 65·9 years (65·5-66·3), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80·9 years (80·9-81·0) and for males 74·8 years (74·8-74·9). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38·0 years (37·5-38·4) for females and 35·6 years (35·2-35·9) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value. We examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.

"PubMed","Global age-sex-specific all-cause mortality and life expectancy estimates for 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1950-2023: a demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","2025","Comprehensive, comparable, and timely estimates of demographic metrics-including life expectancy and age-specific mortality-are essential for evaluating, understanding, and addressing trends in population health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time. We used 24 025 data sources from VR, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources to estimate all-cause mortality for males, females, and all sexes combined across 25 age groups in 204 countries and territories as well as 660 subnational units in 20 countries and territories, for the years 1950-2023. For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods. For each measure, 95% UIs were calculated with the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. In 2023, 60·1 million (95% UI 59·0-61·1) deaths occurred globally, of which 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) were in children younger than 5 years. Due to considerable population growth and ageing since 1950, the number of annual deaths globally increased by 35·2% (32·2-38·4) over the 1950-2023 study period, during which the global age-standardised all-cause mortality rate declined by 66·6% (65·8-67·3). Trends in age-specific mortality rates between 2011 and 2023 varied by age group and location, with the largest decline in under-5 mortality occurring in east Asia (67·7% decrease); the largest increases in mortality for those aged 5-14 years, 25-29 years, and 30-39 years occurring in high-income North America (11·5%, 31·7%, and 49·9%, respectively); and the largest increases in mortality for those aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years occurring in Eastern Europe (53·9% and 40·1%, respectively). We also identified higher than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 5-14 years (87·3% higher in GBD 2023 than GBD 2021 on average across countries and territories over the 1950-2021 period) and for females aged 15-29 years (61·2% higher), as well as lower than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 50 years and older (13·2% lower), reflecting advances in our modelling approach. Global life expectancy followed three distinct trends over the study period. First, between 1950 and 2019, there were considerable improvements, from 51·2 (50·6-51·7) years for females and 47·9 (47·4-48·4) years for males in 1950 to 76·3 (76·2-76·4) years for females and 71·4 (71·3-71·5) years for males in 2019. Second, this period was followed by a decrease in life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to 74·7 (74·6-74·8) years for females and 69·3 (69·2-69·4) years for males in 2021. Finally, the world experienced a period of post-pandemic recovery in 2022 and 2023, wherein life expectancy generally returned to pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2023 (76·3 [76·0-76·6] years for females and 71·5 [71·2-71·8] years for males). 194 (95·1%) of 204 countries and territories experienced at least partial post-pandemic recovery in age-standardised mortality rates by 2023, with 61·8% (126 of 204) recovering to or falling below pre-pandemic levels. There were several mortality trajectories during and following the pandemic across countries and territories. Long-term mortality trends also varied considerably between age groups and locations, demonstrating the diverse landscape of health outcomes globally. This analysis identified several key differences in mortality trends from previous estimates, including higher rates of adolescent mortality, higher rates of young adult mortality in females, and lower rates of mortality in older age groups in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight stark differences across countries and territories in the timing and scale of changes in all-cause mortality trends during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-23). Our estimates of evolving trends in mortality and life expectancy across locations, ages, sexes, and SDI levels in recent years as well as over the entire 1950-2023 study period provide crucial information for governments, policy makers, and the public to ensure that health-care systems, economies, and societies are prepared to address the world's health needs, particularly in populations with higher rates of mortality than previously known. The estimates from this study provide a robust framework for GBD and a valuable foundation for policy development, implementation, and evaluation around the world.

This paper presents GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across age groups, sexes, and locations, while reflecting on the remaining post-COVID-19 challenges to achieving our collective global health ambitions. The GBD 2023 combined analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 375 diseases and injuries, and risk-attributable burden associated with 88 modifiable risk factors. Of the more than 310 000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which were new to this estimation round), more than 120 000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden and 59 000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific time trends over the 2010-23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates per 100 000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution. Total numbers of global DALYs grew 6·1% (95% UI 4·0-8·1), from 2·64 billion (2·46-2·86) in 2010 to 2·80 billion (2·57-3·08) in 2023, but age-standardised DALY rates, which account for population growth and ageing, decreased by 12·6% (11·0-14·1), revealing large long-term health improvements. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1·45 billion (1·31-1·61) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1·80 billion (1·63-2·03) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4·1% (1·9-6·3) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90·2 million [75·2-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62·8% [34·0-107·5]), depressive disorders (26·3% [11·6-42·9]), and diabetes (14·9% [7·5-25·6]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25·8% (22·6-28·7) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49·1% (32·7-61·0) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42·9% (38·0-48·0) for HIV/AIDS, and 42·2% (23·6-56·6) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16·5% (10·6-22·0) and 24·8% (7·4-36·7), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15·6% (10·7-19·8) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1·27 billion [1·18-1·38]) of the roughly 2·80 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8·4% (6·9-10·0) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30·7% (24·8-37·3); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6·7% (2·0-11·0) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54·4% (38·7-65·3) for unsafe sanitation, 50·5% (33·3-63·1) for unsafe water source, and 45·2% (25·6-72·0) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44·9% (37·3-53·5) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10·5% [0·1 to 20·9]), drug use (8·4% [2·6 to 15·3]), and high FPG (6·2% [-2·7 to 15·6]; non-significant). Our findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage.

"PubMed","Comparative Evaluation of Pain Control Using 4% Articaine Buccal Infiltration and 2% Lignocaine Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block for Pulpectomy in Primary Mandibular Second Molars in the Children of Age-group 6-10 Years: A Split-mouth Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.","2025","This study aims to evaluate pain control using 4% articaine buccal infiltration and 2% lignocaine inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) for pulpectomy in primary mandibular second molars in children of age category of 6-10 years. In pediatric dentistry, one of the most significant aspects of child behavior management is pain control during injecting local anesthesia. This leads to building trust, allaying fear or anxiety, and promoting a positive dental attitude. IANB is the preferred technique for achieving pulpal anesthesia during the treatment of mandibular primary molars. About 2% lignocaine is the most commonly used anesthetic agent in dentistry. Administration of 2% lignocaine using IANB is difficult in pediatric patients, as it may lead to uncooperative behavior in child, whereas administration of 4% articaine through buccal infiltration is comparatively more feasible in child and also reduces the postoperative complications. Hence, this study aims to compare pain control using 2% lignocaine IANB and 4% articaine buccal infiltration. Children between 6 and 10 years were selected for the study. It was split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial. About 40 primary mandibular second molars were randomized from 20 children. Two categories were as follows: (1) category A-4% articaine buccal infiltration was administered and then pulpectomy procedure was performed, and (2) category B-2% lignocaine IANB was administered and then pulpectomy procedure was performed. It indicated that 4% articaine buccal infiltration had a lower mean pain score than 2% lignocaine IANB using Wong-Baker's face pain scale for objective evaluation and comparing subjective mean pain scores using Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) during pulpectomy procedure. (1) Pulpectomy is possible by depositing 4% articaine buccal infiltration. Articaine is an effective local anesthetic and can be used as an alternative to lignocaine nerve block in children. (2) No significant adverse effects were observed after the use of 4% articaine. Articaine is an effective local anesthetic and can be used as an alternative to lignocaine in children. Delivering comfortable anesthesia is essential, as it increases both patient's trust and treatment acceptance while at the same time reducing personal stress level.

"PubMed","Effect of immersive virtual reality on pain in different dental procedures in children: a randomized controlled clinical trial.","2025","Effective pain management techniques are fundamental for enhancing patients' adherence to various pediatric dental procedures. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) on pain perception during dental procedures in children. Children aged between 5 and 12 years were recruited from a pediatric dental clinic. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained from all parents or guardians. The need for different dental procedures was determined for each child based on the outcome of a clinical examination. Some of these procedures require local anesthesia (LA) administration, while others do not. The children were randomly assigned to either a VR or a non-VR group. Three behavioral scales, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, and the ""Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability"" (FLACC) Scale, were used to assess the pain level during dental procedures. A total of 154 children were recruited and evenly divided into VR and non-VR groups (77 each). The results of the study indicated that utilizing VR during dental procedures resulted in a significant reduction in pain perception (p < 0.05) and doubled the level of relaxation experienced by patients (70.31%), irrespective of anesthesia requirements. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the VR and anesthesia groups across all VAS and Wong-Baker FACES variables. This research has confirmed that using virtual reality (VR) as a distraction technique effectively reduces pain during dental procedures for children. VR is a safe, non-invasive, and user-friendly technique that has gained interest as a non-pharmacological option for pain management. As a result, this promising approach has the potential to be used in clinical practice and should be further researched.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

While lignocaine with adrenaline is widely used, mepivacaine without a vasoconstrictor offers potential benefits in pediatric patients. This study aimed to compare the hemodynamic responses and pain perception associated with 3% mepivacaine (plain) versus 2% lignocaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline in children undergoing pulpectomy. A randomized, double-blind controlled trial was conducted at the Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry of Dr. R. Ahmed Dental College and Hospital, Kolkata, India. Fifty children aged 6-13 years with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis were randomly assigned to receive either mepivacaine or lignocaine through buccal infiltration. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and intraoperative pain (Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale) were recorded at four time points (preoperatively, 5-, 15-, and 30-min postadministration). Comparisons within the group over different time points were performed using Friedman's test, while intergroup comparisons at each time point were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. All analyses were conducted with the significance level set at 5%. The mepivacaine group showed significantly lower HR at T1 (P < 0.0001) and reduced postoperative pain scores (P = 0.0046). SBP and DBP changes were less pronounced compared to lignocaine, though not statistically significant. Mepivacaine without vasoconstrictor provided effective anesthesia with better hemodynamic stability and pain control, supporting its use as a safe alternative in pediatric endodontics, especially where epinephrine use is undesirable.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

"PubMed","The global, regional, and national burden of cancer, 1990-2023, with forecasts to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","2025","Cancer is a leading cause of death globally. Accurate cancer burden information is crucial for policy planning, but many countries do not have up-to-date cancer surveillance data. To inform global cancer-control efforts, we used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 framework to generate and analyse estimates of cancer burden for 47 cancer types or groupings by age, sex, and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023, cancer burden attributable to selected risk factors from 1990 to 2023, and forecasted cancer burden up to 2050. Cancer estimation in GBD 2023 used data from population-based cancer registration systems, vital registration systems, and verbal autopsies. Cancer mortality was estimated using ensemble models, with incidence informed by mortality estimates and mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Prevalence estimates were generated from modelled survival estimates, then multiplied by disability weights to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the GBD standard life expectancy at the age of death. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We used the GBD 2023 comparative risk assessment framework to estimate cancer burden attributable to 44 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risk factors. To forecast cancer burden from 2024 to 2050, we used the GBD 2023 forecasting framework, which included forecasts of relevant risk factor exposures and used Socio-demographic Index as a covariate for forecasting the proportion of each cancer not affected by these risk factors. Progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4 aim to reduce non-communicable disease mortality by a third between 2015 and 2030 was estimated for cancer. In 2023, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, there were 18·5 million (95% uncertainty interval 16·4 to 20·7) incident cases of cancer and 10·4 million (9·65 to 10·9) deaths, contributing to 271 million (255 to 285) DALYs globally. Of these, 57·9% (56·1 to 59·8) of incident cases and 65·8% (64·3 to 67·6) of cancer deaths occurred in low-income to upper-middle-income countries based on World Bank income group classifications. Cancer was the second leading cause of deaths globally in 2023 after cardiovascular diseases. There were 4·33 million (3·85 to 4·78) risk-attributable cancer deaths globally in 2023, comprising 41·7% (37·8 to 45·4) of all cancer deaths. Risk-attributable cancer deaths increased by 72·3% (57·1 to 86·8) from 1990 to 2023, whereas overall global cancer deaths increased by 74·3% (62·2 to 86·2) over the same period. The reference forecasts (the most likely future) estimate that in 2050 there will be 30·5 million (22·9 to 38·9) cases and 18·6 million (15·6 to 21·5) deaths from cancer globally, 60·7% (41·9 to 80·6) and 74·5% (50·1 to 104·2) increases from 2024, respectively. These forecasted increases in deaths are greater in low-income and middle-income countries (90·6% [61·0 to 127·0]) compared with high-income countries (42·8% [28·3 to 58·6]). Most of these increases are likely due to demographic changes, as age-standardised death rates are forecast to change by -5·6% (-12·8 to 4·6) between 2024 and 2050 globally. Between 2015 and 2030, the probability of dying due to cancer between the ages of 30 years and 70 years was forecasted to have a relative decrease of 6·5% (3·2 to 10·3). Cancer is a major contributor to global disease burden, with increasing numbers of cases and deaths forecasted up to 2050 and a disproportionate growth in burden in countries with scarce resources. The decline in age-standardised mortality rates from cancer is encouraging but insufficient to meet the SDG target set for 2030. Effectively and sustainably addressing cancer burden globally will require comprehensive national and international efforts that consider health systems and context in the development and implementation of cancer-control strategies across the continuum of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

"PubMed","Global, Regional, and National Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors in 204 Countries and Territories, 1990-2023.","2025","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality and are among the foremost causes of disability globally. CVD burden has continued to increase in most countries since 1990, with trends driven by changing exposures to harmful risk factors, population growth, and population aging. We report estimates of global, national, and subnational CVD burden, including 18 subdiseases and 12 associated modifiable risk factors. We analyzed change in CVD burden from 1990 to 2023 and identified drivers of change including population growth, population aging, and risk factor exposure. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, a multinational collaborative research study, quantified burden due to 375 diseases including CVD burden and identified drivers of change from 1990 to 2023 using all available data and statistical models. GBD 2023 estimated the population-level burden of diseases in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023. CVDs were the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths estimated in the GBD. As of 2023, there were 437 million (95% UI: 401 to 465 million) CVD DALYs globally, a 1.4-fold increase from the number in 1990 of 320 million (292 to 344 million). Ischemic heart disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and hypertensive heart disease were the leading cardiovascular causes of DALYs in 2023 globally. As of 2023, age-standardized CVD DALY rates were highest in low and low-middle Socio-demographic Index (SDI) settings and lowest in high SDI settings. The number of CVD deaths increased globally from 13.1 million (95% UI: 12.2 to 14.0 million) in 1990 to 19.2 million (95% UI: 17.4 to 20.4 million) in 2023. The number of prevalent cases of CVD more than doubled since 1990, with 311 million (95% UI: 294 to 333 million) prevalent cases of CVD in 1990 and 626 million (95% UI: 591 to 672 million) prevalent cases in 2023 globally. A total of 79.6% (95% UI: 75.7% to 82.5%) of CVD burden is attributable to modifiable risk factors 347 million [95% UI: 318 to 373 million] DALYs in 2023). Globally, high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and air pollution were the modifiable risks responsible for most attributable CVD burden in 2023. Since 1990, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors have had mixed effects on CVD burden, with increases in high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, and low physical activity leading to higher burden, while reductions in tobacco usage have mitigated some of these increases. Population growth and population aging were the main drivers of the increasing burden since 1990, adding 128 million (95% UI: 115 to 139 million) and 139 million (95% UI: 126 to 151 million) CVD DALYs to the increase in CVD burden since 1990. CVD remains the leading cause of disease burden and death worldwide with the greatest burden in low, low-middle, and middle SDI regions. Large variation exists in CVD burden even for countries at similar levels of development, a gap explained substantially by known, modifiable risk factors that are inadequately controlled. The decades-long increase in CVD burden was the result of population growth, population aging, and increased exposure to a subset of risk factors led by metabolic risks. Countries will need to adopt effective health system and public health strategies if they are to progress in achieving global goals to reduce the burden of CVD.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","What Factors Affect Safe Bedside Extubation After Mandibular Distraction?","2025","ObjectiveThere is no universal protocol for extubation following mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) surgery in infants with Robin sequence (RS). The aims of this study were to identify the frequency and contributing factors for reintubation after MDO, to help determine the optimal setting for planned extubation.DesignThis is a retrospective observational study of patients with RS managed with MDO during their first year of life from 2013 to 2021.Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome variable was the need for reintubation <24 h after extubation. A secondary outcome was the frequency of oxygen saturation <95% after extubation.ResultsFifty-two subjects were included. Of these, 31 (59.6%) were male, 43 (82.7%) had a cleft palate, 19 (36.5%) were syndromic, and 24 (46.2%) had ≥1 comorbidity. Extubation was at 3.6 ± 2.4 days after surgery and 1 patient (1.9%) required reintubation. Forty-one (78.8%) had ≥1 transient oxygen desaturation managed with supplemental oxygen (n = 25, 61%) or continuous positive airway pressure (n = 16, 39%). Increased risk for postextubation respiratory events was associated with Stickler syndrome (P = .01), musculoskeletal, neurologic, or endocrine comorbidities (P < .001), low birthweight (P = .044), and high preoperative obstructive Apnea-Hypopnea Index (P = .037).Conclusions and RelevanceReintubation was rare and minor postextubation oxygen desaturations, while common, were readily treated utilizing standard intensive care unit protocols. We conclude that most infants with RS can be safely extubated in their care unit following MDO. This minimizes medical resources, decreases hospital charges, and simplifies patient management compared to returning to the operating room for extubation.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

This study aims to develop a preclinical MA model to investigate the dynamic interplay between craniofacial structural defects and neurobehavioral dysfunction. Longitudinal behavioral phenotyping including von Frey filaments test as well as open field and elevated plus maze tests reveals progressive sensory hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors, with computational ethology revealing subtle but consistent alterations in the naturalistic behaviors. Whole-brain activity mapping reveal hyperactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), whereas multi-omics profiling reveal cell type-specific transcriptional changes and synaptic reorganization within this region. Functional investigation including sparse labeling, electrophysiology, western blotting, and chemogenetics demonstrate that the ACC modulation regulated both pain and anxiety. These findings establish a causal association between structural craniofacial defects and maladaptive neural circuit remodeling, with the ACC emerging as a critical therapeutic target. The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how anatomical abnormalities translate into persistent neurological dysfunction and offers new avenues for mechanistically informed intervention.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the behavioral management techniques: stress ball and the hands-eyes-mouth distraction technique (HEM-DT). Three groups of 60 preschool children participated in the study: group I (control group: communication), group II (stress ball distraction), and group III (HEM-DT). After applying topical lidocaine gel to the buccal mucosa, local anesthetic (LA) was deposited. The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) was used to measure dental pain following the administration of local anesthesia, while the Facial Image Scale (FIS) was used to measure anxiety. A pulse oximeter was used to measure the pulse rate. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the groups (p < 0.05). HEM-DT showed significant difference on comparing pre-FIS and post-FIS scores, with a p-value of 0.014. Pulse rate was comparatively lesser in HEM-DT. When comparing WBFPRS between the three groups, HEM-DT exhibited significant difference. HEM-DT technique was found to be better than stress ball technique and communication. The HEM-DT is a useful tool in pediatric dentistry that helps divert a child's attention from the needle and reduce their pain perception during various treatments.

In this retrospective analysis, 172 pneumothorax cases (148 patients aged >12 years, 24 patients aged ≤12 years) with both chest radiographs and confirmatory thoracic CT were included from a tertiary emergency department. Patients were categorized by age and pneumothorax size (small/large). Each radiograph was presented to all three LLMs accompanied by basic symptoms (dyspnea or chest pain), with each model analyzing each image three times. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using overall accuracy (all three responses correct), strict accuracy (≥2 responses correct), and ideal accuracy (≥1 response correct), alongside response consistency assessment using Fleiss' Kappa. In patients older than 12 years, ChatGPT-4o demonstrated the highest overall accuracy (69.6%), followed by Claude 3.5 (64.9%) and Gemini 2.0 (57.4%). Performance was significantly poorer in pediatric patients across all models (20.8%, 12.5%, and 20.8%, respectively). For large pneumothorax in adults, ChatGPT-4o showed significantly higher accuracy compared to small pneumothorax (81.6% vs. 42.2%; p < 0.001). Regarding consistency, Gemini 2.0 demonstrated excellent reliability for large pneumothorax (Kappa = 1.00), while Claude 3.5 showed moderate consistency across both pneumothorax sizes. This study, the first to evaluate these three current multimodal LLMs in pneumothorax identification across different age groups, demonstrates promising results for potential clinical applications, particularly for adult patients with large pneumothorax. However, performance limitations in pediatric cases and with small pneumothoraces highlight the need for further validation before clinical implementation.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

Although lidocaine is the reference standard, articaine has been proposed as a less invasive alternative due to its superior diffusion properties. A randomized, single-blind, noninferiority clinical trial was conducted with 76 children aged 6 through 9 years requiring extraction of maxillary primary molars. Participants were allocated into 2 groups: single buccal infiltration with 4% articaine and conventional buccal and palatal infiltration with 2% lidocaine. The primary outcome was self-reported pain using a visual analog scale (ie, a 10-cm horizontal line where 0 represented no pain and 10 represented the most pain imaginable). Noninferiority was assessed with a predefined margin of 1.5 cm. Negative binomial regression was used to explore predictors of pain. Mean (SD) pain scores were significantly higher in the articaine group (4.18 [3.41] cm) than the lidocaine group (1.68 [2.71] cm; P < .001). The upper limit of the 95% CI (3.90 cm) exceeded the noninferiority margin, precluding confirmation of noninferiority (P = .919). Results of regression analysis showed that articaine was associated with 2.15 times higher pain scores (P = .008) and increased heart rate correlated with increased pain (P = .023). Our findings do not support the use of buccal infiltration with 4% articaine only as a noninferior technique to conventional lidocaine infiltration with palatal injection in pediatric maxillary molar extractions. Buccal infiltration with articaine only may not be sufficient to ensure adequate anesthesia for extraction of maxillary primary molars. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Significant reductions in pain for the objective and subjective measures were noted in the thermomechanical device group (P ≤ .00016). No differences in pain ratings were noted in groups based on treatment sequence. Less pain was observed when the thermomechanical device (Buzzy) was used during IANB injections vs without the device.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Evaluation of the Effect of Local Anesthesia for Dental Treatment on Physiological Parameters and Recovery Outcomes in Children Undergoing Dental Treatment Under General Anesthesia.","2025","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of local anesthesia (LA) for dental treatment of children under general anesthesia (GA) on physiologic parameters of patients and recovery of the patients. This information is important because currently, no guidelines exist to define the usage of local anesthetics in dental cases under GA. Methods: This study was designed as a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Intraoperatively, physiologic parameters, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) were observed during points of potential stimulation, and the corresponding time was recorded from the monitor of the operation room. The Aldrete scoring system was then recorded for all the included participants. Results: There were 34 children (55.9% boys, 44.1% girls, age 2-7 years) for whom the dental treatment was done under GA in the study. The mean age was 4.08 ± 1.31 years. ETCO2 was significantly lower in the group that received LA than in those that did not (p  < 0.05). Aldrete's score in the group that received LA was significantly higher than that did not (9 vs. 9.47 ± 0.51, p = 0.002). Conclusion: In conclusion, we found LA provides better intraoperative vital sign stability, particularly regarding heart rate and ETCO2. Also, patients who did not receive LA had statistically significantly higher ETCO2 than those patients who received LA.

"PubMed","Plasma proteomic markers of pain and emotional dysfunction in fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome.","2025","Pain in Fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS) remains poorly understood and inadequately managed due to uncertainties regarding clinical or biological drivers. This cross-sectional pilot study aimed to use plasma proteomics to identify markers that inform on molecular pathways associated with pain and emotional symptoms in FD/MAS. Seventeen individuals (15 females, 2 males), aged 16 to 63 years, with confirmed diagnoses of monostotic FD, polyostotic FD, or MAS participated in a single study visit conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and Massachusetts General Brigham. During the visit, participants completed validated questionnaires assessing neuropathic pain characteristics, pain interference, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and perceived stress, and provided plasma samples. These samples were analyzed for 57 proteins using Olink proximity extension assay. Associations between protein concentrations and symptom scores were evaluated using Spearman's correlations with false discovery rate correction (|r| > 0.5, p < 0.05). After FDR correction, the concentrations of seven proteins (TNF-α, LTA, CCL19, CSF2, CCL2, CCL4, CCL7) significantly correlated with pain interference, HADS-depression scores, or perceived stress. Four protein concentrations (TNF-α, CCL19, CSF2, CCL7) significantly correlated with multiple clinical measures. This pilot study identified several pain-associated proteins in individuals with FD/MAS, suggesting that proteomic profiling may be a promising approach for discovering pain biomarkers. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to validate these results and investigate whether targeting immune pathways can alleviate pain and improve emotional health in FD/MAS.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

A total of 108 children under 6 years old who underwent SECC dental treatment under general anesthesia at the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Third Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Medical University from March to December 2023 were selected as the study subjects, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of classⅠor Ⅱ. The study subjects were divided into a control group (n=54) and an experimental group (n=54) by retrieving intraoperative cases and postoperative follow-up records. The control group was given general anesthesia through inhalation combined with nasotracheal intubation, whereas the experimental group was given local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine on each treated tooth on the basis of general anesthesia. The basic information, preoperative anesthesia depth, hemodynamic changes during different surgical procedures, postoperative pain, and adverse reactions in the two groups were recorded and analyzed. No statistically significant difference was found in the basic information and preoperative anesthesia depth between the two groups (P>0.05). Among the three procedures (pulpotomy, root canal treatment, and tooth extraction), the three observed indicators in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The proportion of patients in the experimental group who needed to take analgesic measures in accordance with the modified facial pain scale (FPS-R) score was significantly lower than that in the control group at postoperative wakefulness and 2 h after surgery (P<0.05). Meanwhile, no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups at 24 h after surgery (P>0.05). The proportion of patients in the experimental group who needed to take analgesic measures on the basis of the parent posto-perative pain measurement (PPPM) score was significantly lower than that in the control group when they were awake after surgery (P<0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between the groups at 2 and 24 h after surgery (P>0.05). Moreover, no statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups at 24 h after surgery (P>0.05). The combination of local anesthesia during SECC dental treatment under general anesthesia results in minimal changes in intraoperative hemodynamics and mild postoperative pain response, hence worthy of clinical promotion.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Effect of needle bevel type on pain perception in children during inferior alveolar nerve block anesthesia: randomized controlled clinical trial.","2025","The difficulty in providing optimal treatment has been related to patients' fear of the discomfort that comes with anesthetic needle insertion. The main purpose of this study is to clinically assess the effect of needle bevel on patient's perception of pain during inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) anesthesia and evaluate the needle tip for mechanical deformation. Sixty-six children 5-7 years old, who were indicated for IANB anesthesia, were selected from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups according to the type of needle bevel used. Group I (n = 33) received INAB anesthesia using double scalpel blade bevel needle, while group II (n = 33) received the injection using conventional bevel needle. Pain reaction was evaluated subjectively using modified Maunuksela face pain scale (FPS) and objectively using Sensory, Eye, and Motor (SEM) scale. After the respective injections, the needles were prepared for microscopic examination. The FPS and SEM showed significantly lower pain scores during IANB anesthesia with double scalpel blade bevel needle compared to the conventional bevel needle (p = 0.002, p = 0.003 respectively). No significant difference in mechanical angle deformation between the two needles was observed (p = 0.837).

"PubMed","Pain experience and behavior management: efficacy of photobiomodulation as an adjunct to local anesthesia in MIH patients-a randomized split-mouth clinical study.","2025","Pain management in children with Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) poses challenges for pediatric dentists. MIH affects the enamel of the first permanent molars and incisors, increasing the risk of cavities, hypersensitivity, and making anesthesia and dental treatments more difficult. Children with MIH often experience dental fear, necessitating effective pain management techniques. Photobiomodulation (PBM) has potential analgesic benefits in dentistry but requires further evaluation for its effectiveness in MIH cases. This study aimed to assess the impact of photobiomodulation on pain control in maxillary permanent molars affected by MIH. In our randomized split-mouth clinical study, 45 participants (25 males, 20 females) aged 7 to 15 years, with both maxillary molars affected by MIH, were assigned to either the intervention group (PBM plus standard anesthesia, n = 45 teeth) or the control group (standard anesthesia alone, n = 45 teeth). PBM parameters included a power of 100 mW, a wavelength of 635 nm, energy of 6 J, fluence of 12 J/cm2, and a duration of 60 s. Pain perception, anesthesia commencement, and its extension time were measured and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 (p < 0.05). The PBM group reported significantly lower subjective pain (mean VAS 2 [1-5]) compared to the control group (6 [2-8]), p < 0.001. FLACC scale scores were also lower in the intervention group (3 [1-5]) compared to the control group (7 [5-8]), p < 0.001. The PBM group showed a lower heart rate (84.6 bpm ± 6.1) compared to the control (113.2 bpm ± 6.1), p < 0.001. Additionally, the anesthesia developed faster in the PBM group (mean: 3.6 ± 0.9 min) compared to the control (6.1 ± 0.8 min, p < 0.001), and the anesthetic effect persisted longer (70.2 ± 3.9 min vs. 50.7 ± 8.9 min, p < 0.001). Photobiomodulation improves pain management and the effectiveness of local anesthesia in maxillary molars affected by MIH by diminishing pain experience and enhancing anesthesia effects, providing a promising approach for pain control in children.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

The search was limited to English-language publications. Additional manual screening of reference lists was performed. The risk of bias was assessed using the checklist developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Out of 574 identified studies, 21 were included in the qualitative analysis (9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 6 case reports and 6 cohort studies), mainly focusing on children aged 6-12. Anesthesia methods included traditional techniques (12 studies) and computer-controlled injection (5 studies). The role of articaine (9) and lidocaine (10) was analyzed. Suggested interventions to mitigate injury risks and improve recovery included the use of phentolamine mesylate (2 studies) and non-pharmacological strategies: intraoral appliances (2 studies) and photobiomodulation (2 studies). The included studies varied in design, sample size and duration, limiting direct comparisons. Effect sizes and confidence intervals were inconsistently reported, and the risk of bias assessment using the Cohen's kappa test highlighted methodological heterogeneity and potential reporting bias. Soft tissue injuries from local anesthesia in children can cause significant pain and cooperation issues. Effective strategies include early intervention with pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Increased awareness and patient-specific management are essential for reducing risks and improving outcomes.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

To address this, we evaluated the efficacy of dermabrasion under surface anesthesia using lidocaine tape. A total of 92 patients underwent dermabrasion following the application of lidocaine tape for varying durations. Results showed that painless treatment was achieved in 25% of patients with 30-59 minutes of application, 61% with 60-89 minutes, and 67% with over 90 minutes. No patient required injectable anesthesia, and all cases showed favorable cosmetic outcomes without complications. Our findings suggest that applying lidocaine tape for at least 60 minutes significantly improves patient comfort and eliminates the need for injectable anesthesia. This approach is effective and less invasive for scar management after cleft lip surgery.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

The research question focused on comparing EP protocols between chairside treatment (CS) and general anesthesia (GA) settings, given clinical protocol differences observed between these modalities. This retrospective analysis included 201 patients with cardiac findings who attended the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at Giessen University Hospital between 2018 and 2023 and underwent dental interventions with bacteremia risk. Patient data included cardiac findings, EP administration protocols, antibiotic agents used, treatment settings, and patient outcomes defined as infective endocarditis (IE) occurrence within three months post-intervention. EP indications were evaluated according to ESC guidelines. Fisher's exact test was used to statistically test differences (GA vs. CS) regarding the outcome and the type of EP medication (α = 0.05). Of all patients, 58.7% received treatment under GA and 41.3% chairside. According to ESC guidelines, EP indication existed in 36.4% of GA patients and 22.9% of CS patients. However, EP was administered in 84.7% of GA patients and 59.0% of CS patients. A significant correlation was found between the variables ""treatment setting"" and ""antibiotic preparation EP"" (p < 0.001). No cases of IE occurred within 3 months, regardless of EP administration or indication status. Besides the limitations of our retrospective study, frequent EP over-administration beyond guideline recommendations was detected, and no IE cases occurred. This aspect could question whether EP indications should be more restrictively defined, particularly in children and adolescents with healthy dental status. • The indication for antibiotic endocarditis prophylaxis (EP) during dental treatment is based on cardiac and dental risk factors. • In 2023, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published new guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis (IE) [1]. • This study highlights the difficulties in implementing guideline-adhering endocarditis prophylaxis and emphasizes the need for strict and comprehensible EP indication in children and adolescents.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Optimal timing for assessing post-intensive care syndrome in clinical research: a scoping review and expert survey.","2025","Since the concept of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) was proposed, numerous studies have assessed patients and their family members. However, a wide range of assessment timings has been employed across previous studies. This study aimed to clarify how assessment timings have been implemented in existing PICS research through a scoping review, and to explore expert opinions on optimal assessment timing via an online survey. We conducted a scoping review of studies assessing PICS-related outcomes, including physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments, as well as PICS in family members. Studies were retrieved from MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL, and screened by two independent pairs of reviewers. Eligible studies were published between January 2014 and December 2022. Studies lacking a clear description of assessment timing were excluded. We analyzed the reference point used to determine assessment schedules, the assessment time points, and their frequency. Additionally, an online questionnaire was administered to 23 members of the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine PICS committee and working group members to collect expert opinions on these three aspects for clinical research. A total of 657 studies were included. In prior studies, hospital discharge was the most commonly used reference point for determining assessment schedule (240 studies, 40%). However, ICU discharge was identified by experts as the ideal reference point (16 votes, 47%). The most frequently used assessment time points were 3 months (262, 23%), 6 months (212, 19%), and 12 months (206, 18%) post-discharge. Experts most commonly selected the period between 6 and 12 months as the optimal time point for assessment. While single assessments were most common in previous studies (337, 51%), experts considered three assessments to be ideal (12, 44%). This study revealed notable discrepancies between the assessment timing reported in previous studies and the opinions of experts regarding optimal timing. Standardization of assessment timing in PICS research is warranted to enhance methodological consistency and comparability.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

To avoid the use of monitoring methods more invasive than the dental procedure itself, cardiac output was continuously assessed using FloTrac™ and BioZ.com™ systems. The bispectral index was maintained between 40 and 67 during anesthesia. Although the patient's body surface area (BSA) was 0.5 m2, which is below the validated threshold for both devices, monitoring was cautiously conducted to observe hemodynamic trends. Discrepancies in the cardiac output and index values were observed between the two modalities. Although the absolute values were less reliable owing to the patient's low BSA, hemodynamic stability was maintained by tracking the dynamic changes in cardiac parameters. These observations underscore both the limitations and the potential of noninvasive cardiac monitoring in pediatric patients with Fontan circulation undergoing general anesthesia. Accordingly, future development of monitoring technologies that can accurately measure cardiac output in pediatric patients with BSA < 1 m2 is warranted.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

Although multiple organs may be involved, skeletal lesions usually represent the most severe and least treatable expression of the disease, leading to bone deformities, spontaneous fractures, and chronic pain that severely reduce patients' quality of life.The recognition of the causative Gαs variants and the consequent ligand-independent activation of the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA pathway has provided a clear molecular explanation to most extra-skeletal pathologies of FD/MAS, leading to the development of effective therapeutic approaches. In contrast, a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that act downstream of the Gαs pathway to generate FD bone lesions and clinical expression thereof remain elusive. Multiple key issues remain to be addressed, including some questions that have recently emerged such as the interaction between mutated and non-mutated cells and the role of the latter in the development of the fibrotic tissue.In this review, we provide a summary of the proof-of-concept, preclinical data, and experimental tools that have emerged to date from basic and translational studies on FD and represent the background for future research on the pathogenesis and treatment of this rare disease.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Comparison of Children's Preferences for Dental Injectors and Their Impact on Cooperation During Local Anesthesia Injection: An Observational Study.","2025","Background Dental fear and anxiety (DFA) are a common challenge in pediatric dentistry, often triggered by fear of pain, unfamiliar instruments, or appearance of dental instruments and injections. This fear significantly affects children's cooperation during procedures, making local anesthesia (LA) particularly anxiety-inducing. Objective This study aimed to evaluate children's level of cooperation during dental procedures in relation to their preference for different types of dental injectors. Materials and methods This study involved 150 children randomly assigned into two equal groups using a lottery method. Group A was given a choice between a metal injector and a plastic injector without stickers on it, while Group B chose a metal injector or a plastic injector with stickers around it. Children's preferences were recorded, and their behavior was assessed using the Frankl behavior rating scale during LA administration. Results In Group A, 43 (57.3%) children chose plastic injectors without stickers compared to 32 (42.7%) preferring the metal injector. In Group B, 62 (82.7%) children preferred plastic injectors with stickers, whereas only 13 (17.3%) chose metal injectors. Behavioral assessments revealed that children in Group A who preferred the plastic injector without stickers exhibited more positive behavior (n = 29, 67.5%), whereas those who preferred the metal injector showed more negative behavior (n = 10, 31.3%). In Group B, children who preferred plastic injectors with stickers showed more positive behavior (n = 43, 69.3%) when compared with those who chose metal injectors in the same group. Across all age groups, children showed more positive behavior toward plastic injectors, particularly those with stickers on them. This difference was statistically significant in the 4-6 and 7-10 years groups (p = 0.039 and p = 0.011, respectively). Conclusion The addition of stickers to plastic injectors significantly improved children's comfort and behavior during dental procedures, particularly in younger children. Older children preferred injectors without stickers, suggesting that age-specific designs enhance cooperation levels and reduce dental anxiety.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

Methods: A randomised, single-blinded controlled trial was conducted among 51 children between the ages of 6 and 12, visiting the paediatric clinic, Jazan (REC-45/10/1070). Children were allocated into one of the following three groups using a simple randomisation having a 1:1:1 allocation ratio into Group I (n = 17): Plain topical anaesthetic gel, Group II (n = 17): Pre-Cooled topical anaesthetic gel, and Group III (n = 17). An ice pack was applied for a period of 1 min at the injection site. The intensity of pain and the behaviour of the children were assessed using Face, Leg, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC), the Modified Wong-Baker Scale (WBS) and the Frankel Behaviour Rating Scale (FBRS). Results: A significant difference in FBRS scores was observed during anaesthesia, with the highest median score [3 (3,3)] in the pre-cooled topical anaesthetic gel group (p value < 0.001).

Transcriptomic analysis identified two gene clusters with opposing transient expression trends post-flight (T2), normalized at T3: one upregulated and the other downregulated. Mapped immune cell types through the CIBERSORT coupled with the pathway analysis suggested monocytes' role in coordinated cellular response. Epigenetic analysis identified four methylation patterns with transient and persistent changes post-flight, enriched in nervous system development and cell apoptosis pathways. Methylation changes implicated genes associated with bone disorders, including FBLIM1, IHH, and SCAMP2. eQTM analysis suggested a link between RNA transcriptional level and DNA methylation through transcriptional regulator ZNF684.

"PubMed","Comparison of Intraosseous and Conventional Dental Anesthesia in Children-A Scoping Review.","2025","Background/Objectives: The main purpose of the present scoping review was to map and explore the efficacy of computer-controlled intraosseous anesthesia (CCIA) in comparison with conventional dental anesthesia in pediatric dental patients. Secondarily, this study aimed to compare the acceptance and preference factors between CCIA and conventional dental anesthesia in children. Given the limited and heterogeneous nature of the available literature, this review aimed to identify gaps and scope the extent of research conducted in this area, providing a foundation for future, more targeted studies. Methods: The search was conducted in 19 electronic databases, and the appropriate studies were identified according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Only split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trials that reported on the clinical outcomes of CCIA in children were included. Two reviewers worked independently on the screening and selection of the studies. The same two reviewers carried out the data extraction and the risk of bias assessment, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Due to the exploratory nature, this review focused on mapping the characteristics, outcomes, and research trends rather than synthesizing effect sizes. Results: Out of 841 papers, 2 randomized clinical trials were ultimately included in the scoping review. The outcomes were categorized as primary (including results that answered the focus question) and secondary (relating to additional quality characteristics). Regarding the primary outcomes, in both studies, intraosseous anesthesia was efficacious in achieving the adequate level of anesthesia. One of the secondary outcomes was the acceptance and preference of CCIA in comparison with conventional dental anesthesia in children. The limited number and the high risk of bias in existing studies highlight the necessity for more comprehensive and high-quality research. Conclusions: The selected studies support the assertion that CCIA is a promising technique since it results in less pain perception and is preferred by patients compared to conventional local anesthesia. However, the existing literature is limited and at high risk of bias. Thus, further targeted investigations are needed to evaluate and yield more definitive results regarding the superiority of CCIA.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Swedish dentists' use of pharmacological pain management in children: a survey.","2025","The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore how Swedish General Dental Practitioners (GDPs) and Specialists in Paediatric Dentistry (SPDs) use pharmacological pain management, focusing on local anesthetics (LA) when treating children. 582 GDPs in southern Sweden and 137 SPDs nationwide received a questionnaire with 4 clinical scenarios covering filling therapy and tooth extractions in children. Each scenario had questions about how often the dentist would use LA and topical anesthetics, answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale (Always, Often, Sometimes, Seldom, Never). The overall response rate was 48.0% (243 GDPs and 102 SPDs). Use of LA reported as Always or Often was more common in SPDs than GDPs for filling therapy in primary molars (98.0% vs. 90.9%, p = 0.019) as well as in permanent molars (99.0% vs. 91.7%, p = 0.006). GDPs who reported Always or Often using LA for filling therapy in primary teeth were younger (42.2 years vs. 49.1 years, p = 0.004) and had fewer years of experience as a dentist (14.2 years vs. 19.9 years, p = 0.016) compared with GDPs reporting less frequent use. There was an underuse of LA among GDPs when treating children. The reasons for refraining from LA are not fully understood, but possible contributing factors can be identified within work environment, insufficient undergraduate training and lack of organizational support and guidelines.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","The role of photobiomodulation in minimizing pain during dental injections in adults and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","2025","This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of laser-based photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in reducing pain associated with dental injections. The review addresses the research question: ""What is the effect of PBMT on pain levels during local anesthetic injections in dental patients compared to control interventions?"". A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies included were prospective or retrospective clinical trials involving PBMT for pain control during dental injections. The quality of studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Data were extracted on patient demographics, laser parameters, and pain outcomes. A total of 14 studies were included in this systematic review, with 6 focusing on children and 8 on adults. In children, three studies indicated that PBMT effectively reduced pain, with a significant difference according to the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (WFPRS) but not on the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale. Conversely, three studies found no significant differences between PBMT and topical anesthesia. In adults, five studies demonstrated a pain-reducing effect of PBMT, though one study reported a statistically significant difference that did not achieve clinical significance. The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant overall effect of PBMT on pain reduction in both children and adults (p < 0.05). This systematic review of the literature suggests that PBMT may help reduce discomfort associated with dental injections in both adults and children. Nonetheless, further investigation is warranted to arrive at a more definitive conclusion on this topic.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Challenges in Management of Compromised First Permanent Molar With Pathologic Perforation and Periapical Lesion in a 10-Year-Old Boy: A Case Report.","2025","First permanent molars play a critical role in mastication, development of occlusion, dentoalveolar growth and maintenance of dentofacial and skeletal harmony. The first permanent molar is the most caries-prone tooth in the permanent dentition due to its early exposure to the oral environment. Additionally, it takes the longest time to develop from its intrauterine formation to eruption in the oral cavity making it particularly susceptible to hypoplastic changes during development. It has been frequently observed that the age of the child, stage of growth and development, incomplete root formation, limited working area in pediatric patients, behavioural changes, and delayed reporting to the dental clinic complicate the management and affect the long-term prognosis of the molar. Management of compromised first permanent molars (cFPM) in pediatric patients presents several challenges, including behavioural issues, limited cooperation, incomplete root formation, restricted working space, and delayed presentation to dental clinics. These factors, along with difficulties in achieving effective local anesthesia, poor saliva control, and the rapid progression of carious lesions, further complicate treatment and affect the long-term prognosis. The present paper describes the management of compromised first permanent molar in a 10-year-old boy with carious and pathologic furcation involvement and compromised periodontal prognosis using Triple antibiotic paste, Tricalcium silicate cement, intra-operative and post-operative challenges during its management. At follow-up, the tooth was evaluated clinically for the presence of pain, swelling, and difficulty in mastication. Radiographic assessment was performed over a specified time period to monitor the resolution of the periapical lesion and to confirm signs of bone healing and re-establishment of the lamina dura.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"

This report presents a case involving a six-year-old girl who had a broken upper right first molar due to decay for the past three months. An extraction was planned under LA. Following the infiltration technique of LA administration using 2% lignocaine solution with 1:80,000 adrenaline, swelling appeared in the right infraorbital region almost immediately. The swelling resulted from inadvertent deposition of the anesthetic in the infraorbital area due to excessive needle penetration, which occurred as the child became uncooperative during the injection. The patient was prescribed analgesic eye drops and a topical ophthalmic ointment by the ophthalmologist, and the symptoms started subsiding within four hours. This report also explores prevention and management strategies for such complications in pediatric dental care.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Pain Management and Parafunctional Activity Secondary to Local Anesthesia in Children 4-12 Years Old-A Retrospective Study.","2025","Objective: Successful local anesthesia reduces patient pain and anxiety, facilitates the procedure, and enhances overall comfort; however, in children, it may also increase the risk of parafunctional activities in anesthetized areas. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the factors influencing the risk of self-inflicted injuries. Methods: A study was conducted from January to December 2023 using the records of 4285 pediatric patients aged 4-12 years who underwent dental treatment under local anesthesia. Among 1161 cases at Poznan University (Poland), 73 (6.3%) of self-inflicted injuries were reported. At Rome University (Italy), 823 cases were reviewed, with 522 involving local anesthesia and 23 cases (4.4%) of trauma. Results: The overall prevalence of trauma following local anesthesia was 5.9%, indicating significant clinical concern. The lips were the most commonly affected (69.9%), followed by the cheeks (15.1%) and tongue (15.1%). The study confirmed a positive correlation between younger age and higher trauma incidence, with no significant differences in sex or ethnicity. Longer anesthesia duration and higher anesthetic doses were associated with increased lesion severity. The type of anesthetic also played a role, with articaine showing a higher risk compared to lidocaine. Furthermore, the type of injection influenced trauma incidence, due to the distribution of numbness and exploratory behaviors. Conclusions: Local anesthesia remains an indispensable tool in pain management in pediatric dentistry. However, the risk of self-inflicted injuries is not limited to the youngest patient. Proper education on post-anesthetic care is essential for minimizing complications and ensuring safe and effective dental treatment.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:52.186311"
"PubMed","Melatonin versus midazolam in the premedication of anxious children attending for elective surgery under general anaesthesia: the MAGIC non-inferiority RCT.","2025","Anxiety in children prior to general anaesthesia is common, with up to half displaying distress. Anxiety and distress may lead to unsuccessful anaesthesia, together with greater postoperative pain, agitation and behavioural changes after surgery including sleep disturbances. Midazolam is the current standard premedication; however, it has adverse effects such as the potential for respiratory suppression and unpredictable effects which may result in agitation rather than anxiolysis. Melatonin is an alternative preoperative anxiolytic; however, previous trials have delivered conflicting results. The aim of this non-inferiority trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin compared to midazolam in reducing anxiety in children undergoing general anaesthesia. We undertook a randomised-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, non-inferiority trial in 20 United Kingdom National Health Service trusts, with an embedded qualitative study and health economic evaluation. Anxious children having day case elective surgery under general anaesthesia were randomly assigned to either control (standard of care) group: midazolam; or intervention group: melatonin. The primary outcome was preoperative distress (non-inferiority hypothesis) as assessed by modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale Short Form. Secondary outcomes included safety and efficacy objectives. Analyses were by intention to treat, with an additional per-protocol analysis. The sample size of the trial was 624 children. The trial was stopped early due to recruitment futility. Between 30 July 2019 and 9 November 2022, 110 children were recruited; 55 allocated to midazolam and 55 allocated to melatonin. Pre-planned analyses showed an adjusted mean difference of 13.1 (95% confidence interval 3.7 to 22.4) for the intention-to-treat population and 12.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 22.6) for the per-protocol population, in favour of midazolam. In both analyses, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval exceeds the predefined margin of 4.3; therefore, melatonin is not non-inferior to midazolam. The lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals excludes zero and thus melatonin is inferior to midazolam; the difference found is considered to be clinically meaningful. Adverse events in the midazolam arm (26%) were slightly higher than melatonin (18%); there were no serious adverse events in either arm. Challenges to recruitment included study-related factors (eligibility criteria and trial design), participant factors (caregiver stress on the day of treatment) and practitioner factors (valuing predictability). In terms of acceptability, preferences of the anaesthetist, patient and caregiver factors and medication side effects profile were influential and suggest the choice of preoperative anxiolytic is more complex than previously described. On average, costs over the 14 days post surgery were lower for those who received melatonin (-£46.20, 95% confidence interval -£166.14 to £66.74) with a mean incremental difference in procedure success of -0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.08 to 0.004), although there was uncertainty around the results. In children with preoperative anxiety, midazolam is more effective than melatonin at reducing preoperative anxiety prior to general anaesthesia, although the early termination of the trial increases the likelihood of bias. The trial was prematurely terminated due to recruitment futility. Despite this, a clinically meaningful and statistically significant finding was observed about the primary outcome. There remains a need to develop or repurpose another drug with a more favourable side effects profile to midazolam.

To assess VR's impact on anxiety in children (6-12 years) during dental treatments with local anesthesia. In this clinical trial, we assessed anxiety levels in children (6-12 years) undergoing local anesthetic dental procedures using VR animation. Initially, we utilized the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED) questionnaire for patient selection, in which 44 children were recruited, but eight were excluded, leaving 36 participants who were randomly assigned to either a VR group or a control group with no VR (18 participants each). Anxiety was measured using the MCDAS(f) questionnaire, along with heart rate and oxygen saturation. The results demonstrated that VR significantly reduced anxiety, as reflected in lower MCDAS(f) scores. Moreover, heart rate reductions were notably greater in the VR group compared to the control group (p < 0.001 for both measures), indicating a clear decrease in anxiety. VR shows promise for reducing dental anxiety and improving treatment outcomes, though additional research is needed to assess its long-term effects. The incorporation of VR in routine pediatric dental care may improve child cooperation and reduce reliance on pharmacological sedation.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

"PubMed","Treatment of deciduous teeth in children using the Er:YAG laser compared to the traditional method: A randomized clinical trial.","2025","Erbium family lasers have been used as an alternative method for the treatment of dental caries in deciduous teeth, in comparison to traditional methods. The study aimed to determine the most optimal erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er:YAG) laser settings for carious lesions in deciduous teeth on different surfaces with the evaluation of treatment time and pain level on a visual analog scale (VAS). The randomized clinical trial involved 66 teeth with deep caries in 33 children aged 3-8 years, divided into 2 study groups: Er:YAG laser (test group); and conventional treatment with a dental turbine (control group). The time required for caries removal and cavity preparation using both methods was recorded. The inclusion criteria encompassed generally healthy pediatric patients, pain-free subjects, first-time dental appointment, and unicuspid primary teeth with caries. Dental caries treatment was performed without the administration of local anesthesia. The cavity preparation time was on average 2.5 times longer when the Er:YAG laser was used compared to the conventional method. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the Er:YAG laser in hard tissue preparation of deciduous teeth with a pulse energy of 230 mJ for enamel preparation, mainly on occlusal and proximal surfaces, and with a pulse energy of 120 mJ and 150 mJ for dentin preparation. Optimum operating frequencies were 10 Hz and 20 Hz with corresponding water consumption. The level of discomfort among the laser-treated patients indicated 0 based on VAS, meaning no pain. Among patients treated with the traditional method, the pain level averaged 5.27. The use of the Er:YAG laser offers substantial advancements in comparison to traditional treatment with dental turbines by enhancing the overall comfort during caries therapy in children. It fosters better patient cooperation and reduces the need for intraoperative anesthetics due to its minimally invasive nature and the fact that it is a relatively quiet operation. This approach minimizes anxiety and discomfort often associated with dental procedures, making them more amenable to children.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Hemodynamic Response to Tracheal Intubation Using Indirect and Direct Laryngoscopes in Pediatric Patients: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.","2025","Purpose: Hemodynamic response, particularly increased heart rate (HR) and blood pressure, can occur during tracheal intubation and is an adverse event to be avoided. The aim of this study was to use a network meta-analysis (NMA) to develop a ranking of hemodynamic responses (HR and mean blood pressure, MBP) after intubation of indirect and direct laryngoscopes in pediatric patients. Method: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had a prospective randomized design, compared hemodynamic response (HR and MBP) to tracheal intubation between indirect and/or direct laryngoscopes, and were conducted in pediatric patients. The pooled difference between each intubation device's intubation time is expressed as a weighted mean difference (WMD) of a 95% confidence interval (CI). The intubation time of the device was evaluated using P-scores calculated from the network point estimates and standard errors. A random-effects model was used when pooling effect sizes. We also analyzed intubation time as a related factor to hemodynamic responses. Results: From the electronic databases, we selected 16 trials for review. In a Macintosh-referenced analysis, Airtraq suppressed an increase of HR and MBP during tracheal intubation in pediatric patients significantly more than a Macintosh laryngoscope. (HR; WMD = -16.7, 95%CI -22.5 to -10.9, MBP; WMD = -8.57, 95%CI -10.9 to -6.27). Airtraq also topped the HR and MBP P-score rankings. The results of this study showed similar laryngoscopes in the top five rankings of P-scores (Airtraq, Coopdech video laryngoscope, Miller, C-MAC, Wis-Hipple) for HR and intubation time. Conclusions: We applied a network meta-analysis to create a consistent ranking of intubation devices that prevent hemodynamic changes during tracheal intubation in pediatric patients. In this NMA, Airtraq proved to be the best laryngoscope for preventing hemodynamic responses during tracheal intubation in pediatric patients. In the analysis of intubation time, Airtraq showed the shortest intubation time.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

Patients between the ages of 4 and 10 years who were admitted to our clinic and required extraction of their maxillary deciduous molars under local anesthesia were included in our study. Infiltration anesthesia with a conventional dental injector was applied to one of the symmetrical teeth, and a Comfort-in jet injection system was applied to the other. The Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C) anxiety scale was administered to children. The Wong-Baker Pain Rating Scale (WBPRS) and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scales were applied to the children during the injection. The physiological parameters of the children were evaluated using pulse oximetry. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS V23 software (SPSS Inc., IBM Co., Somers, NY, USA). The significance level was set at P < 0.050.

"PubMed","Efficacy of virtual reality hypnosis versus conscious sedation with nitrous oxide in the management of dental anxiety in pediatric dentistry: protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial.","2025","Dental anxiety is defined as a persistent and excessive fear of dental treatment. It often leads to interruptions during procedures and, frequently, avoidance of dental care. For patients over the age of 7, nitrous oxide-oxygen inhaled sedation (NOIS) represents one of the most effective and well-established pharmacological approaches to reducing anxiety and pain during dental treatment. Meanwhile, medical hypnosis offers an interesting non-pharmacological alternative by inducing a hypnotic state, potentially serving as a means of sedation to alleviate anxiety or pain. The advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology makes medical hypnosis more accessible to dental practitioners, yielding promising outcomes. To our knowledge, no clinical trial has evaluated the efficacy of medical hypnosis associated with 3D immersive virtual reality devices for pediatric dental procedures. This prospective, controlled, single-blind clinical study including anxious patients aged 7 to 10 years old aims to demonstrate non-inferiority of virtual reality approach. Using a split-mouth design, each patient will attend two separate visits for two comparable conservative dental procedures. At the first procedure, they will randomly be assigned to receive either hypnosis via VR or NOIS. The alternative method will be administered during the second visit. The primary outcome is the sedation success based on the completion of the dental procedure. A score of 3 or higher on the Modified Venham Scale noted more than twice ends the session and qualifies as a sedation failure. The secondary outcomes involve assessing children's tolerance and the temperament influence on sedation success. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a novel non-pharmacological sedation for the management of anxious children in a dental setting. The results may help practitioners choose the appropriate anxiolytic therapeutic option, based on different psychometric and temperament parameters. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05167331.

It was a single-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled trial with three arms. Forty-five specimens were assigned randomly to three groups: Group 1: Chemomechanical caries removal (CMCR) utilizing Carisolv. Group 2: CMCR utilizing BRIX3000. Group 3: Control group, caries excavation utilizing conventional rotary-mechanical method. Lesions reaching the middle or inner third of the dentine (D2/3) were observed in immature mandibular PFMs with no pulpal and/or periodontal issues included. The efficacy of caries removal was considered the primary outcome measure. It was recorded using the Ericson et al. scale by visual-tactile examination and the caries detector, which includes five levels to rate the amount of carious dentin remaining. The secondary outcome measures were subjective and objective pain assessment and the requirement of local anesthesia. Continuous and categorical data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests, respectively. A significance level of p < 0.05 was adjusted. All conventional-method cases (100%) and the majority of Carisolv and BRIX3000 cases (80%) showed complete caries removal and a mean score of (0.27 ± 0.59) and (0.20 ± 0.41) (p = 0.185), respectively. The conventional method group showed the highest mean score (2.07 ± 0.88) of the sound, eye, motor (SEM) scale compared with the Carisolv and BRIX3000 (p < 0.05) groups, which exhibit lower mean scores (0.80 ± 0.77), (0.67 ± 0.72), respectively. For the Wong-Baker FACES scale, the conventional method group recorded the highest mean (7.07 ± 3.01) compared to the Carisolv and BRIX3000 (p < 0.05) groups, which had considerably lower mean scores of (2.53 ± 2.77) and (2.00 ± 2.39), respectively.

"PubMed","Nasopharyngeal airway-assisted sedation enhances oxygenation and reduces perioperative adverse events in pediatric dental surgery: A comparative clinical study.","2025","Perioperative airway management during pediatric dental procedures remains challenging, particularly in balancing oxygenation stability with procedural safety under intravenous sedation. This randomized trial compared nasopharyngeal airway (NPA)-assisted intravenous sedation (n = 30) versus traditional nasal cannula oxygenation (n = 30) in 60 children aged 6-12 years undergoing dental surgery. Both groups received standardized midazolam-propofol sedation and perioperative monitoring. Primary outcomes encompassed oxygen saturation (SpO2), adverse events (aspiration, choking, mucosal bleeding), sedation efficacy, and surgeon satisfaction. The NPA group demonstrated superior SpO2 maintenance at key procedural stages (p < 0.05), with a 78% reduction in hypoxemia episodes compared to controls. Notably, aspiration and choking incidents decreased significantly (p < 0.05), yielding a fourfold lower overall adverse event rate (6.67% vs 30.00%, p = 0.001). Sedation quality metrics revealed enhanced behavioral cooperation (p < 0.001) and optimal sedation depth (Ramsay scores: p < 0.001) in the NPA cohort, though pain perception remained comparable between groups (p > 0.05). Surgeons reported 93.33% satisfaction with NPA-assisted cases versus 33.33% with conventional methods (p < 0.001), correlating with fewer procedural interruptions. These findings establish NPA as a clinically superior modality for pediatric dental sedation, offering dual benefits of improved oxygenation stability and procedural workflow efficiency. The technology addresses critical gaps in perioperative safety while maintaining hemodynamic equilibrium, positioning it as a viable optimization strategy for high-risk pediatric populations.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

Methods: The randomized split-mouth study included 30 patients (17 boys, 13 girls) aged 8.22 ± 1.8 years. The application of atomized lidocaine spray or cream was randomly used in the maxillary second premolar region. The parameters were measured prior to and following each needle insertion after being applied for 10, 30, 60, and 120 sec. Paired t-test and independent t-test were used for statistic analyses. Results: Compared with the first applications (10 s), atomized lidocaine and EMLA cream applications significantly decreased scores of VAS at the 30 and 120 s applications, respectively. Despite atomized lidocaine showing an early effect compared with EMLA, there were no significant differences in VAS scores between the atomized lidocaine and EMLA cream at the 60 and 120 s measurements. Although HR significantly increased at first anesthetic administration with the atomized lidocaine spray, HR significantly decreased at 30 and 120 s administrations. Conclusions: Atomized 10% lidocaine-based topical anesthetics significantly reduced pain more rapidly and better than EMLA from needle pricks in the buccal mucosa. Therefore, atomized lidocaine topical anesthesia could be used as a substitute for EMLA cream prior to buccal anesthetic administration. On the other hand, further comprehensive studies are required to explore the effects of several doses of atomized lidocaine in various areas of the oral cavity.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world.

While the contributions of microglia-mediated immune and neurotrophic signalling have been well-characterized, the phagocytic and synaptic pruning roles of microglia in neuropathic pain remain less understood. Here, we show that peripheral nerve injury induces microglial engulfment of dorsal horn synapses, leading to a preferential loss of inhibitory synapses and a shift in the balance between inhibitory and excitatory synapse density. This synapse removal is dependent on the microglial complement-mediated synapse pruning pathway, as mice deficient in complement C3 and C4 do not exhibit synapse elimination. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the complement protein C1q prevents dorsal horn inhibitory synapse loss and attenuates neuropathic pain. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the complement pathway promotes persistent pain hypersensitivity via microglia-mediated engulfment of dorsal horn synapses in the spinal cord, revealing C1q as a therapeutic target in neuropathic pain.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Use of Virtual Reality in the Pediatric Perioperative Setting and for Induction of Anesthesia: Mixed Methods Pilot Feasibility Study.","2025","Children commonly experience high levels of anxiety prior to surgery. This distress is associated with postoperative maladaptive behaviors. Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative tool for reducing anxiety and pain during various medical procedures. Previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing children's anxiety in the preoperative waiting room or during induction. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of VR distraction throughout the perioperative period, from the waiting room until the induction of general anesthesia (GA). Secondary aims were to assess its clinical utility, tolerability, and initial clinical efficacy. A mixed methods, concurrent triangulation feasibility trial was piloted at the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Canada. Participants played an interactive VR game throughout the perioperative period, starting from the waiting room until induction. Feasibility was examined with the duration of the VR intervention, recording the number of interruptions, and taking field notes. Clinical utility was assessed using a perception questionnaire. Tolerability was evaluated by the Child Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (CSSQ). Initial clinical efficacy was assessed by the Faces Pain Scale-Revised, Faces Anxiety Scale, Graphic Rating Scale for multidimensional pain, the Induction Compliance Checklist, and the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale. Quantitative data were supported with field notes and semistructured interviews with patients and parents. Quantitative and qualitative themes were compared via the triangulation protocol to produce final themes. A total of 39 patients, with a mean age of 11.9 (SD 2.8) years, undergoing elective surgery under GA participated in the study. Stakeholders, including patients, parents, and health care providers, were receptive and willing to adapt to VR. Of the 39 patients, 19 (49%) continued to use VR during transportation and 6 (15%) were induced with VR. Barriers to feasibility included (1) interruptions to VR in 92% (36/39) of patients by health care professionals, (2) unpredictable surgery delays prolonging the duration of the VR intervention (mean 23.1, SD 24.4 minutes; range 5-150 minutes), and (3) discontinuation of VR before induction due to mask seal (n=3) and discomfort with supine positioning (n=2). Patients were generally satisfied with VR, deemed it acceptable and easy to use, and would recommend it to others. VR was tolerable with no self-reported simulator sickness (CSSQ: mean 0.01, SD 0.1). The mean Faces Anxiety Score was 1.5 (SD 1.1) at baseline and 0.7 (SD 0.9) during VR. While VR demonstrated good clinical utility and was well tolerated in the broad perioperative setting, this study highlighted important feasibility barriers in the waiting room and especially during induction of anesthesia, both at the organizational and technical levels. This study highlights several considerations that should be carefully addressed for the successful implementation of perioperative VR.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Interaction of Erdosteine with TrkA Signaling Pathways: Implications for Analgesia.","2025","Thiol-containing drugs may interact with a region of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), potentially inhibiting its activation by nerve growth factor (NGF). This action has been linked to potential analgesic activities. Here, we describe the ability of erdosteine, a thiolic compound classified as a mucolytic agent, to bind to the TrkA receptor sequence in silico and its in vitro effects on TrkA activation induced by NGF in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that erdosteine and its metabolite, Met-1, bind to the TrkA receptor pocket, involving the primary TrkA residues Glu331, Arg347, His298, and His297. Furthermore, Met-1 has the ability to reduce the disulfide bridge between Cys300 and Cys345 of TrkA. In vitro measurement of TrkA autophosphorylation following NGF activation confirmed that erdosteine and Met-1 interfere with NGF-induced TrkA activation, leading to a consequent loss of the molecular recognition and spatial reorganization necessary for the induction of the autophosphorylation process. This effect was inhibited by low millimolar concentrations of the two compounds, reaching a maximal inhibition (around 40%) after 24 h of exposure to 1 mM erdosteine, and then plateauing. These findings suggest that erdosteine can act as a TrkA antagonist, thus indicating that this drug may have potential as an analgesic via a novel non-opioid mechanism of action operating through NGF signaling inhibition at the level of TrkA.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

Changes in HR indicated that not viewing the needle elicited greater fear than seeing it, for children aged 4 to 8 years when ""Tell-Show-Do"" is used. Pain perception and behaviour were not affected.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Comparison of injection pain levels using conventional and computer-controlled local anesthetic delivery systems in pediatric dentistry: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","2025","This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of computer-controlled local anesthetic delivery (CCLAD) systems in reducing injection pain in pediatric patients aged 3-14 years, including subgroup analysis across different injection techniques. Randomized controlled trials comparing pain perception associated with CCLAD versus conventional injection methods in children published from January 2015 to November 2024 were included. Comprehensive searches were performed in Embase, Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, limited to articles published in English. From 1253 identified studies, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis revealed that CCLAD significantly reduced pain perception based on the Wong-Baker Pain Rating Scale (WBS) (SMD = -0.98, p = 0.011) and heart rate (HR) measurements (SMD = -0.25, p = 0.013), with high and moderate heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup analysis indicated significant pain reduction with CCLAD compared to conventional Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block (IANB) on WBS, though findings varied across other scales and injection methods, demonstrating some non-significant differences. No significant differences were observed in other pain assessment parameters. The overall risk of bias was low in five studies, with evidence certainty ranging from very low to moderate. CCLAD demonstrates potential as a non-pharmacological tool for reducing injection pain in children, particularly as assessed by WBS and HR. Furthermore, CCLAD significantly reduced pain compared to conventional IANB injections in subgroup analyses. Additional research is necessary to optimize treatment protocols and further evaluate the impact of CCLAD on objective pain measures. This study highlights the benefits of CCLAD in pediatric dentistry, particularly its effectiveness in minimizing pain and stress during local anesthetic injections, especially for IANB procedures. Using CCLAD can enhance patient comfort, improve cooperation, and foster a positive dental experience, thereby supporting better treatment outcomes in pediatric patients requiring precise and low-pain care.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Management of postoperative pain in neonatal intensive care units in Japan.","2025","Neonatal postoperative pain management in Japan is not as standardized as bedside procedural pain, where evidence-based guidelines are widespread, which causes a knowledge gap. To identify postoperative pain management issues, we analyzed the anonymous survey online or by mail by neonatologists or head nurses in 89 Japan's neonatal intensive care units (levels III and IV). Although 79 units (88.8%) required recommendation for postoperative pain management, 11 units (12.4%) used a pain scale for pain assessment, 35 units (39.3%) had evaluated and recorded the pain assessment, 27 units (30%) had updated the postoperative pain management plan, less than bedside procedure, and 14 units (15.7%) had made a preoperative pain management plan. Pain management among neonatal nurses and neonatologists and pediatric surgeons and anesthesiologists have been in three units (3.4%) for preoperative, and in six units (6.7%), and postoperative pain management consult was provided in 15 units (16.9%), which means Initiatives at facilities are essential. We suggest evidence-based practical recommendations in Japan are necessary for neonates to minimize postoperative pain, enhance neonatal postoperative pain management knowledge, and provide consistent postoperative pain management appropriate to the neonates' condition by multidisciplinary collaboration among neonatal nurses, neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, and pediatric anesthesiologists.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Pain and Anxiety Levels During Dental Restorations in Primary Molars: INJEX Needleless System vs Traditional Syringe.","2025","BACKGROUND Fear of discomfort can affect children's behavior. This study aimed to compare pain and anxiety levels of children undergoing dental restoration using a conventional technique and INJEX. MATERIAL AND METHODS A split-mouth, randomized controlled study was conducted on 25 children aged between 7 to 10 years. Children who required restoration were randomly allocated to one of the 2 groups: Group I (traditional system) and Group II (INJEX) [25 teeth in each group]. Following standard behavior guidance, a single operator delivered anesthesia. After 3 minutes, the restoration was performed. Pain intensity was assessed using Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) and Wong-Baker Faces Rating Pain scale (WBS), while child behavior was assessed using the Frankl Behavior Rating scale (FBRS). RESULTS Significant differences (P value <0.001) were observed between the 2 groups when the FLACC scores were analyzed during the administration of local anesthesia. There was a notable difference (P value <0.001) found in the WBS scores before and after injection, among which higher scores [4(2,6)] were observed in the traditional system group. CONCLUSIONS INJEX technique manifested benefits in the form of reduction in pain intensity levels felt by children, and their attitudes remained positive throughout the restorative procedure, which improve the experiences of both the child and the dental practitioner. The INJEX system could be a versatile alternative to the conventional technique. INJEX can be used to reduce preoperative fear and postoperative pain and the amount of anesthesia delivered.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

A split-mouth, parallel arm, Double blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted on children (12 - 16 yrs) undergoing bilateral orthodontic extractions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TENS or PBST. Subjective and Objective parameters for anxiety and pain were assessed, and evaluated for statistical significance (p < 0.05). In this study with 104 patients (mean age 13.59), the TENS group showed significantly lower mean pain scores (WBPRS) for needle insertion (2.30 ± 2.7) versus PBST (5.03 ± 3.1, p < 0.01), LA administration (2.11 ± 2.8 vs. 4.84 ± 2.7, p < 0.01), and extraction (1.92 ± 2.6 vs. 3.23 ± 5.1, p < 0.01). TENS also led to a faster onset of local anesthesia (96.15 s ± 13.9) compared to PBST (155.38 s ± 91, p < 0.05), indicating enhanced efficacy for pain reduction and anesthesia speed. Physiological parameters like pulse rate and salivary pH also showed significant improvements with TENS. Hence TENS and PBST both came out as effective alternatives for topical anesthesia. Both TENS and PBST proved to be effective alternatives to topical anesthesia, TENS therapy with the Synapse Dental Pain Eraser (DPE) demonstrated greater effectiveness in reducing pain and anxiety, reflecting it as a promising option for pediatric patients.

"PubMed","Analysis of Adverse Events Associated With Dental Local Anaesthetics Using Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System Data.","2025","Local anaesthetics (LAs), almost indispensable aspect of dental practice for pain-free procedures, occasionally leads to worrisome adverse events (AEs). We aimed to compare serious and nonserious AEs of LAs for dental reasons in the US Food and Drug Administration AE Reporting System. We retrospectively analysed dental AE reports associated with LAs in the Food and Drug Administration AE Reporting System database from its inception to April 2024. We described AEs by patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and compared ester and amide LA-associated AEs by their severity. We identified 1956 dental cases with a significant increase of AE reports after 2017. Lidocaine and articaine were the most commonly reported LAs (40.4% and 39.2%, respectively). Serious AEs constituted 46.2%, more commonly in females than males (56.6% vs 43.4%, P < .001) and in those on concomitant medications (70.2% vs 42.2, P < .001). These were also significantly higher in epinephrine-containing LAs (70.1%) than that without (34.2%, P < .01). Ester LAs had increased risk of serious AEs (odds ratios [OR]: 3.86; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.77-5.39), particularly as hospitalization, life-threatening event, or death. The odds of serious AEs were lower with lidocaine (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.48-0.71) and articaine (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.52-0.76). Our study showed higher rate of serious AEs with ester LAs and those with vasoconstrictor-added practices. Besides, serious outcomes appear as more likely in females and those where additional drug use was reported. The integration of clinical evidence with pharmacovigilance data has the potential to influence clinicians' LA preferences in dental practice, enabling more informed and evidence-based decision-making.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Comparison of Bupivacaine Trocar Site Infiltration and Peritoneal Instillation for Postoperative Pain in Pediatric Laparoscopic Surgery.","2025","Background Laparoscopic surgery has become the treatment of choice for pediatric patients due to its numerous advantages over open surgery. However, postoperative pain remains a significant barrier to rapid recovery. The intraperitoneal use of local anesthetics for pain management is underutilized in the pediatric population. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of bupivacaine administered at the trocar site versus in the peritoneal cavity for managing postoperative pain in pediatric laparoscopic surgery. Methodology This quasi-experimental study was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Surgery at the Combined Military Hospital, Lahore. A total of 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery were divided into two groups of 40 each. The W Group received bupivacaine trocar site infiltration, while the P Group received intraperitoneal bupivacaine instillation at the end of surgery. Pain scores were recorded in both groups at one, two, four, six, and eight hours postoperatively. The need for rescue analgesia and the incidence of shoulder pain were also evaluated as secondary outcomes in both groups. Results The mean pain score was 19.15 ± 3.8 in the W group, compared to 17.30 ± 4.0 in the P group, with a calculated p-value of 0.03, indicating a significant difference between the two groups. Similarly, interval pain scores, the need for rescue analgesia, and the incidence of shoulder pain were significantly lower in the P group compared to the W group. Conclusion We concluded that intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine is more effective than trocar site infiltration with the same agent in reducing postoperative pain across various pediatric laparoscopic procedures. This approach should be adopted to maximize the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in the pediatric population.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

Intraosseous anesthesia, administered via the QuickSleeper system, has shown promise as an alternative to traditional local anesthesia techniques. A single-blinded split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial took place at the dental hospital at King Saud University with 33 healthy patients (aged 4-9 years), who required pulpotomies and stainless steel crown procedures on two mandibular primary molars, to evaluate the effectiveness of two local anesthetic techniques. Each tooth was randomly assigned to receive 4% articaine either delivered via the intraosseous route using QuickSleeper 5 or buccal infiltration. The effectiveness of the anesthesia was evaluated by the number of injections needed and at various stages using the Sounds, Eyes, and Motor (SEM) scale. Postoperative complications, including pain, swelling, and lip numbness, were assessed through follow-up phone calls with the patients' legal guardians. The techniques demonstrated comparable effectiveness; there were no statistically significant differences in the number of injections and in the SEM scale scores. Minimal postoperative complications were reported: lip biting (two cases) and prolonged numbness (nine cases) were reported only when buccal infiltration was used, and swelling and pain were reported when both techniques were used. Intraosseous anesthesia via the QuickSleeper 5 system is comparable to traditional buccal infiltration anesthesia for pulpotomies and stainless steel crown procedures in pediatric mandibular molars. Intraosseous anesthesia offers the added benefit of reduced soft tissue numbness and associated complications.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

Caries experience (dmf-t/DMF-T), type of anaesthesia and pre- and perioperative parameters were recorded. Regardless of disease, all children showed higher caries experience in the primary dentition compared to permanent dentition (mean ± standard deviation; 6.44 ± 4.85/2.01 ± 3.87). Most of the children suffered from genetic syndrome, followed by congenital heart and metabolic disease. Dental treatment was mostly performed under general anaesthesia. 92.2% of those patients were intubated orotracheally and 66.9% received antiemetics. The complication rate was lower than 3%. Data show that special healthcare needs patients regardless of kind of disease are highly affected by caries and require dental treatment. Most dental restorations were performed under general anaesthesia. Regardless of disease and type of anaesthesia, the complication rate was low, which underlines the high clinical relevance of adequate dental care under general anaesthesia for this vulnerable patient group.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

The study specifically focuses on children, aiming to determine whether distraction methods can effectively reduce anxiety levels, alleviate pain experiences, and improve cooperative behavior in a clinical setting. Children aged 4 to 9 years receiving routine dental care at the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic, Istanbul Medipol University, were randomly assigned to Group 1 (distraction first, then tell-show-do) or Group 2 (tell-show-do first, then distraction), with a two-week washout period before switching interventions. Anxiety was assessed using the Venham Picture Test and pulse rate, pain perception with the Sounds, Eyes, and Motor Scale during local anesthesia and the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale during treatment, while cooperation and behavior were evaluated using the Houpt Scale. Statistical analysis was conducted using Mann-Whitney U, Student's t-test, Paired t-test, and Wilcoxon test, with the significance level set at 0.025 using the Bonferroni correction. Sixty-eight patients (37 female, 31 male) with a mean age of 6.69 ± 1.08 years completed the study (Group 1: n = 32, Group 2: n = 36). The cartoon-assisted distraction technique did not significantly reduce anxiety compared to the tell-show-do method. A non-significant reduction in pain perception was observed during local anesthesia with distraction. However, this technique significantly reduced self-reported pain during treatment (p < 0.025) and improved child cooperation and behavior. Cartoon-assisted visual and auditory distraction can alleviate pain perception and improve behavior during pediatric dental procedures. However, it does not appear to reduce dental anxiety or pain perception during local anesthesia. Integrating this technique with the traditional tell-show-do approach may enhance the pediatric dental experience.

The medical records of children with ASD undergoing dental treatment under general anesthesia (n = 40) were analyzed in this study. The collected data included demographic profile, medical status (ASD severity and associated comorbidities), dental history (behavior, care approach, past dental treatment, and follow-up period), caries pattern (surface and depth), and clinical and radiographic findings (e.g., percussion/palpation pain, fistula, furcation involvement, and pathologic resorption). We compared the caries patterns and treatment of children with ASD to those of their healthy counterparts (n = 40). In children with ASD, age and severity were significantly associated with presentation behavior (P = .03 and P = .04) and the chosen care approach (P = .03). Clinical and radiographic examinations revealed that furcation involvement or pathological resorption was more frequent in children with ASD from families with lower average monthly income (P = .05) and in those with associated comorbidities (P = .02). Caries involving 1 or 2 surfaces were more prevalent in children with ASD, with a significant proportion extending to the dental pulp (P < .001).

Prospective controlled (non-)randomized clinical trials comparing caries excavation using a laser to using conventional burs. Four electronic databases (Central Cochrane, PubMed-Medline, Ovid-EMBASE, Web of science) were screened. Outcomes were e.g. restoration survival, excavation speed, pulp sensitivity/vitality, need of anesthesia, pain sensation. No time restrictions were applied. Risk of Bias and level of evidence was graded using Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and Grade Profiler. Twenty in vivo studies with at least 2263 teeth being assessed in more than 1090 patients were included. Meta-analysis for comparing laser vs. bur revealed that restoration survival (risk ratio (RR)[95%CI]=1.51 [0.87;2.64, low level of evidence) and pulp vitality (RR[95%CI]=1.46 [0.33;6.46], low level of evidence) was not significantly influenced by the use of a laser. Furthermore, significantly fewer patients required anesthesia (RR[95%CI]=0.29 [0.11;0.75, very low level of evidence) and patients' pain sensation was significantly decreased (RR[95%CI]=0.35 [0.22;0.54], very low level of evidence) when a laser was used for excavation and preparation. In contrast, when using a laser for excavation/preparation significantly more time has to be planed compared to the use of a conventional bur (mean difference [95%CI]=2.23 [1.89;2.57], low level of evidence). Using a laser for excavation/preparation treatment does not affect restoration survival and pulp vitality compared to the use of conventional burs, while the need of anesthesia and patients' pain sensation can be reduced. However, significantly more time must be spent to achieve these benefits. Laser-assisted caries removal reduces the need for anesthesia and minimizes patient discomfort compared to conventional rotary instruments, while restoration survival and pulp vitality are not affected. However, excavation speed remains significantly slower. Furthermore, results should be interpreted with caution considering the low level of the evidence.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of ice and benzocaine gel as topical agents for pain management during local anesthetic administration via a computer-controlled local anesthetic delivery (CCLAD) system. A split-mouth, single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted involving healthy children aged between 5 and 10 years who required maxillary bilateral local anesthesia for dental procedures. The objective pain was measured using the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale during the administration of local anesthetic via CCLAD, with the application of topical agent, ice, and benzocaine gel. Moreover, subjective pain was evaluated using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. The topical ice group showed a lower Wong-Baker Facial Pain Scale score compared to the group using benzocaine gel; however, the observed difference was not statistically significant. Topical ice application showed a lower modified pain scale score compared to the benzocaine gel group; however, the observed difference was not statistically significant. Topical ice shows better results when compared to benzocaine topical anesthetic gel. Topical ice application along with CCLAD is an almost zero-pain injection technique in pediatric dentistry. Pain management during local anesthesia injection is a critical step in gaining initial trust during dental treatment. Precooling the injection site with cryotherapy is beneficial in reducing pain before local anesthesia injection in pediatric patients. Ninawe N, Anija CK.

Articles had to be systematic reviews or meta-analysis linked with the management of dental anxiety and acute dental pain, as well as chronic orofacial pain. Twelve articles were selected for analysis, with 8 on dental anxiety, 3 on temporomandibular disorders, and 1 on burning mouth syndrome. Several literature reviews and meta-analyses published on the subject support the use of hypnosis in several clinical contexts, including local anesthesia, dental extraction and dental anxiety in adults and children. Evidence is also presented to improve the condition of patients suffering from pain associated with temporomandibular disorders. However, the literature remains somewhat fragmented because of the diversity of hypnosis techniques applied, and the different dental procedures or conditions explored. Hypnosis can have a considerable impact in the management of dental anxiety and acute dental pain. It also seems promising for the management of orofacial pain, but further research would be necessary. This research highlights that the available evidence is sufficient to encourage the integration of evidence-based hypnosis training to improve the management of acute stress and pain in dental practice.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

Despite the use of behavioral control techniques, some young children cannot undergo treatment in the office, making sedation or general anesthesia necessary. Premedication drugs can be used before general anesthesia to reduce anxiety, control pain, induce amnesia, prevent nausea, and avert potential complications. The search for the ideal premedication for children is ongoing. This study aims to compare the effects of pregabalin and midazolam (MID) in children undergoing dental treatment under general anesthesia. This prospective, triple-blind study included 64 children aged 2 - 6 years who required dental treatment under general anesthesia. Participants who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. One group of children received pregabalin syrup, while the other group received MID syrup. The comfort of the child during separation from the parents, ease of venous access, and degree of sedation upon entering the operating room were evaluated. Blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels were measured at baseline and every 30 minutes thereafter. Additionally, the duration of the patient's stay in recovery until discharge was recorded and compared between the two groups. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Fisher's exact test, and SPSS version 14 software. No statistically significant differences were found between premedication with MID and pregabalin in terms of anxiety during venous access, parental separation anxiety, restlessness in recovery, duration of recovery stay, or changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen levels between the two groups. However, a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the degree of sedation before entering the operating room.

A retrospective chart review of 324 patients who underwent 404 oral moderate sedations with (DMH) from April 2017 to June 2022. Sedations were graded as Successful or Unsuccessful and Positive (Frankl F3 or F4) or Negative (Frankl F1 or F2) behavior. Primary variables included Frankl behavior at consult and medication dosages. Logistic regression models were used to determine if these factors were associated with sedation success and behavior while adjusting for other patient and sedation characteristics. DMH yielded mostly successful sedations (89%) and Positive Behavior (Frankl F3 or F4) (72%). Lower Frankl scores at consult (OR: 2.3, p = 0.0140) were associated with increased odds of sedation failure. Increased age (OR: 0.8, p = 0.0047) was associated with decreased odds of failure. Meperidine dose demonstrated a significant association with improved sedation while controlling for age and behavior (p < 0.0001). The (DMH) is an effective moderate sedation regimen. Patient selection is a significant factor in sedation success.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Comparative Evaluation of Alveolar Nerve Block with 2% Lidocaine-Epinephrine and 4% Articaine-Epinephrine Buccal Infiltration in Mandibular Premolar and Molar Region in Children: A Double-Blind, Randomized Trial.","2025","Background/Objectives: Effective pain control in pediatric dentistry combines behavior management, local anesthesia, and follow-up care. This study compared the efficacy of inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) with 2% lidocaine and epinephrine versus buccal infiltration (BI) with 4% articaine and epinephrine in treating primary molars, permanent premolars, and molars in children. Methods: Sixty children aged 5-18 years were randomly assigned to two groups in a double-blind study. One group received 1.7 mL BI with 4% articaine, and the other 1.8 mL IANB with 2% lidocaine for dental treatment. Pain was assessed using the self-reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (W-BFRS), while anesthesia effectiveness and behavior were evaluated using the Frankl Behavior Rating Scale (FBRS) and vitality tests. Results: The articaine group reported significantly lower pain scores on all scales (VAS: 1.23 ± 2.01; FBRS: 0.47 ± 0.57; W-BFRS: 1.33 ± 2.04) than the lidocaine group (VAS: 3.17 ± 1.64; FBRS: 1.26 ± 0.45; W-BFRS: 3.17 ± 1.64). Articaine also outperformed lidocaine in secondary measures, with higher positive responses on the questionnaires (articaine: 8.37 ± 1.61 vs. lidocaine: 5.27 ± 1.41, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Buccal infiltration with 4% articaine is more effective than 2% lidocaine administered via IANB for invasive dental procedures in children, providing superior pain control and positive patient responses.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"
"PubMed","Perioperative airway management techniques and complications in patients with temporomandibular joint ankylosis: Experience from a tertiary care teaching institute.","2025","Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) ankylosis patients pose serious anesthetic challenges due to difficult airway and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, data are sparse on anesthetic management and perioperative outcomes of such patients. This study aimed to identify the anesthetic and airway management techniques in children and adolescents with TMJ ankylosis and whether the presence of retrognathia and OSA increases the risk of airway-related complications. A retrospective anesthetic chart review of TMJ ankylosis patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery from 2008 to 2018 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in India was performed. Available anesthetic data were tabulated and analyzed. Difficult mask ventilation, use of nasopharyngeal airway (NPA), difficult intubation, desaturation at induction and extubation, maneuvers to open the airway at extubation, and any post-operative anesthetic complications were noted. Three hundred seventy-two children including 85 patients of OSA were available for analysis. All patients with OSA had retrognathia. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) guided intubation was performed in 362 (97.3%) patients. Desflurane and fentanyl were common anesthetics used for the maintenance of anesthesia. Difficult mask ventilation, use of nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) and requirement of airway maneuvers were more common in OSA patients than in non-OSA patients. Difficult mask ventilation was observed in 18.0% and difficult intubation in 12.9% of patients. Desaturation at induction was noted in 5.1% of patients but none required emergency surgical airway access. Maneuvres to open the airway at extubation were required in 24.5% of patients and the incidence of desaturation at extubation was 7.2%. However, no serious adverse event was noted and only one patient required reintubation. FOB-guided intubation should be considered the technique of choice in TMJ ankylosis patients. In the presence of retrognathia and OSA chance of difficult mask ventilation, requirement of NPA and difficulty in maintaining the airway after extubation increase significantly.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

This report describes a case in which the initial diagnosis was eruption sequestrum based on clinical information but which was later found to be a complex odontoma based on histopathological findings. The patient was an 8-year-old girl who presented at our hospital with the chief complaint of pain in the right mandibular molar region. The distal aspect of the right mandibular first molar, which had partially erupted, was covered with gingiva and hard tissue which were separated from the tooth itself. X-ray findings showing radiopaque hard tissue at this site indicated a clinical diagnosis of eruption sequestrum. After local infiltration anesthesia, the hard tissue was extracted and a gingivectomy performed. Histopathological examination of the excised material, however, indicated a diagnosis of complex odontoma.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:35:54.464448"

"PubMed","Melanocytic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy: A plethora of airway nightmares!","2025","Melanocytic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy (MNTI) is a rare, benign neoplasm involving the jaw. It is characterized by a high rate of recurrence and locally aggressive enlargement. This condition often leads to facial asymmetry and difficulty in airway management during surgical excision. Due to its rarity, there are no established guidelines for the perioperative management of MNTI. We describe the successful airway and anaesthetic management of three paediatric cases of MNTI. These cases highlight the complexities of airway management in paediatric patients with limited oral space and facial asymmetry. The anaesthetic approach prioritized meticulous preparation for potential difficult airway scenarios, including obtaining high-risk consent, assembling appropriate equipment, and premedication with ketamine and glycopyrrolate. Inhalational induction with sevoflurane was employed, and video laryngoscopy was used to aid intubation. Muscle relaxation and analgesia were carefully managed intraoperatively, with an emphasis on minimizing opioid usage postoperatively. The cases illustrate the importance of teamwork and multidisciplinary collaboration in managing challenging paediatric airway scenarios. This series contributes to the understanding of anaesthetic considerations in MNTI cases and underscores the significance of thorough preparation and coordination in optimizing patient outcomes.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

A 23-item web-based survey was conducted. The first part collected demographic data, while the second included 16 multiple-choice questions based on clinical scenarios involving pulpal treatment of mandibular primary molars. Participants indicated their primary and alternative anaesthesia choices. Data were analyzed using SPSS v25.0 (p < 0.05). A total of 330 paediatric dentists participated (mean age: 30.64 ± 5.01 years; 90% female). Anaesthesia preferences varied significantly by age, tooth position, and treatment type (p < 0.05). For pulpectomy in first primary molars, buccal infiltration was preferred in 4-year-olds (53.4%), whereas inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) was more common in 7-year-olds (60.1%, p = 0.002). In second molars, IANB was commonly preferred in both age groups, with significantly higher use in older children (p = 0.001). In pulpotomy procedures, buccal infiltration anaesthesia (BI) was mainly used in 4-year-olds (62.8% for first molars; 37.6% for second molars), while IANB was preferred in 7-year-olds (56.3% and 70.7%, p = 0.004 and p < 0.001). When the initial anaesthesia failed, intrapulpal (IPA) and intraligamentary anaesthesia (ILA) were the most common alternatives. Paediatric dentists' anaesthesia preferences are influenced by patient age, tooth position, and treatment type. The study reflects the importance of adapting anaesthesia techniques to clinical conditions and patient needs.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","Is Digital Anesthesia a Viable Alternative for Pain and Anxiety Control in Pediatric Dentistry?","2025","Pain and anxiety during dental procedures remain major challenges in pediatric dentistry, particularly during local anesthesia administration. This study compared the effectiveness of digital anesthesia systems versus conventional infiltration and mandibular block techniques in managing pain, anxiety, and behavioral responses in pediatric dental patients. Seventy-nine children aged 6-12 were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia via digital anesthesia system (DAS), infiltration, or mandibular block. Pain was assessed using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFRPS), anxiety via the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDAS), and behavioral responses through the FLACC scale. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and chi-square tests (p < 0.05). Children in the DAS group reported significantly lower pain scores during needle insertion, anesthetic delivery, and treatment. Post-treatment MCDAS scores decreased significantly in the DAS group, especially for items related to ""tooth examination,"" ""filling,"" and ""gingival injection."" FLACC results also indicated more favorable behavioral responses-such as relaxed facial expressions and absence of crying-in the digital group (p < 0.05). Digital anesthesia appears to be a highly effective alternative to conventional techniques for minimizing pain, reducing dental anxiety, and improving behavioral cooperation in pediatric patients, supporting its broader implementation in clinical practice.

"PubMed","Global, regional, and national sepsis incidence and mortality, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis.","2025","The global burden of sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated host response to infection leading to organ dysfunction, remains challenging to quantify. We aimed to comprehensively estimate the global, regional, and national burden of sepsis, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and underlying causes of sepsis-related deaths with co-occurring infectious syndromes. We used multiple cause-of-death, hospital, minimally invasive tissue sampling, and linked death certificate and hospital record data representing 149 million deaths, covering 4290 location-years with mortality estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to capture explicit and implicit sepsis cases and deaths. We estimated age-location-sex-specific fractions of sepsis-related deaths from 195 underlying causes of death and 22 infectious syndromes from 1990 to 2021 using binomial logistic regression models, and estimated sepsis-related deaths using GBD cause-specific mortality estimates. Using 250 million hospital admissions and 7·82 million deaths from hospital data, representing 1310 location-years, we modelled case fatality rates by use of binomial logistic regression, applied to sepsis death estimates to estimate sepsis incidence by age, location, and year. In 2021, we estimated 166 million (95% uncertainty interval 135-201) sepsis cases and 21·4 million (20·3-22·5) all-cause sepsis-related deaths globally, representing 31·5% of total global deaths. Sepsis-related deaths decreased between 1990 and 2019, followed by a surge in 2020 and 2021. As of 2021, individuals aged 15 years and older experienced increases across incidence (230%) and mortality (26·3%) since 1990. Those aged 70 years and older had the highest sepsis-related mortality in 2021 (9·28 million [8·74-9·86] deaths). Sepsis-related deaths from infectious underlying causes decreased from 11·8 million (11·1-12·5) in 1990 to 8·34 million (7·72-9·01) in 2019, then increased by 86·4% to 15·5 million (14·7-16·4) in 2021. Sepsis-related mortality due to non-infectious underlying causes of death increased from 4·69 million (4·35-5·05) in 1990 to 5·81 million (5·40-6·25) in 2021; the leading non-infectious underlying causes of death with sepsis were stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cirrhosis. In 2021, bloodstream infections inclusive of HIV and malaria (3·08 million [2·83-3·35]) and lower respiratory infections inclusive of COVID-19 (11·33 million [1·20-1·47]) were the most prominent infectious syndromes complicating sepsis-related deaths from non-infectious underlying causes, representing a consistent trend since 1990. The global burden of sepsis increased in 2020 and 2021, reversing progress from 1990. Sepsis incidence and mortality increased in people aged 15 years and older, especially those aged 70 years and older, and as a complication of non-infectious underlying causes of death such as stroke, primarily through bloodstream infections and lower respiratory infections. The global burden of sepsis is substantial, and sepsis is increasingly a complication of non-infectious causes of death.

In this clinical study, 48 healthy children requiring invasive dental treatment were divided into two groups: the mobile dental app group (group I) and the kaleidoscope group (group II). Group I used the ""Little Lovely Dentist"" app before receiving LA, while group II viewed various designs through a kaleidoscope prior to anesthesia administration. Anxiety levels were assessed using physiological measures [pulse rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rate] and subjective measures [facial image scale and Wong-Baker faces pain rating scale (WBFPS)] at preoperative and postoperative time points. The kaleidoscope group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all measured parameters compared to the dental app group postintervention (p = 0.000). Group II exhibited decreased pulse and respiratory rates, increased SpO2, and reduced pain scores, while group I showed slight increases in pain scores and significant increases in respiratory and pulse rates. The findings suggest that using a kaleidoscope as a distraction technique is more effective than a mobile dental application in alleviating dental anxiety and pain in children during the administration of LA.

Local anesthesia is essential for pain control, but the injection process often causes fear and anxiety in children. Topical anesthetics are used to alleviate injection-associated pain; however, conventional anesthetics lack sufficient adhesion and efficacy. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of a novel articaine mucoadhesive (AMA) patch formulated with 4% articaine for pain control during local anesthetic injections (inferior alveolar nerve block) and subgingival tooth preparation for stainless steel crown (SSC) placement. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study design (CDCRI/DEAN/ETHICSCOMMITTEE/PEDO/PG-02/2024). The study was conducted with 60 children aged 6-12 divided into two groups: local anesthetic site (inferior alveolar nerve block) and tooth preparation for SSC. Each group was further divided into subgroups that received either the articaine or placebo patches. Pain responses were assessed using sound-eye-motor (SEM) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. A significance level of 5% was used for the analysis. Shapiro-Wilk and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess the data. The AMA patch significantly reduced pain compared to the placebo (p = 0.001). The SEM and VAS scores for the articaine patch were 1.236 and 2.102 (local anesthetic site), and 1.547 and 2.477 (tooth preparation for SSC), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups (p > 0.7). The AMA patch demonstrated effective pain reduction during local anesthetic injection and tooth preparation, offering promising results for pediatric pain management, with enhanced compliance and localized effects.

"PubMed","Evaluating the impact of camouflaged and insulin syringes with and without counter-stimulation on anxiety and behavior in children during administration of local anesthesia.","2025","Fear of injections and dental anxiety are the major barriers to successful pediatric dental treatment. Visual threats associated with conventional syringes can increase anxiety and pain perception in children, necessitating the use of child-friendly strategies. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the impact of camouflaged and insulin syringes, with and without counter-stimulation, on anxiety levels, pain perception, and behavioral responses during local anesthesia administration in children. A clinical trial involving 120 children aged 8-10 years who required bilateral maxillary local anesthesia was performed. Local anesthesia with camouflaged and insulin syringes was administered to each child once with and without thumb pressure counter-stimulation. Anxiety was measured using pulse rates, pain was measured using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, and behavior was measured using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale. Statistical analyses were performed using the independent t-test and chi-square test. Both groups were demographically comparable with no significant differences in age (independent t-test, P = 0.539) or sex distribution (chi-square test, P = 0.854). At first appointment, camouflaged syringes showed significantly lower pain scores (3.58 ± 0.74 vs. 4.17 ± 1.37; P = 0.005), lower pulse rates (89.10 ± 5.84 vs. 99.00 ± 1.80 bpm; P < 0.001), and better behavioral responses (FLACC score: 2.27 ± 0.78 vs. 2.80 ± 0.68; P < 0.001) compared with insulin syringes, as assessed by the independent t-test. These effects were further enhanced by counter-stimulation. At second appointment, although overall scores improved in both groups, post-treatment differences between the syringe types were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Camouflaged syringes combined with counter stimulation represent an effective, simple, and non-pharmacological method for reducing anxiety and improving cooperation during local anesthesia administration in pediatric dental patients. However, the findings are limited by the use of a homogenous sample of healthy, cooperative children aged 8-10 years and potential bias due to the inability of blind operators or participants. Future studies should evaluate a broader population and incorporate blind assessment protocols.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

"PubMed","Global burden of 292 causes of death in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","2025","Timely and comprehensive analyses of causes of death stratified by age, sex, and location are essential for shaping effective health policies aimed at reducing global mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations. GBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55 761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46·8 years (95% UI 46·6-47·0) in 1990 to 63·4 years (63·1-63·7) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45·4 years (45·1-45·7) to 61·2 years (60·7-61·6), and for females it increased from 48·5 years (48·1-48·8) to 65·9 years (65·5-66·3), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80·9 years (80·9-81·0) and for males 74·8 years (74·8-74·9). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38·0 years (37·5-38·4) for females and 35·6 years (35·2-35·9) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value. We examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time. We used 24 025 data sources from VR, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources to estimate all-cause mortality for males, females, and all sexes combined across 25 age groups in 204 countries and territories as well as 660 subnational units in 20 countries and territories, for the years 1950-2023. For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods. For each measure, 95% UIs were calculated with the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. In 2023, 60·1 million (95% UI 59·0-61·1) deaths occurred globally, of which 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) were in children younger than 5 years. Due to considerable population growth and ageing since 1950, the number of annual deaths globally increased by 35·2% (32·2-38·4) over the 1950-2023 study period, during which the global age-standardised all-cause mortality rate declined by 66·6% (65·8-67·3). Trends in age-specific mortality rates between 2011 and 2023 varied by age group and location, with the largest decline in under-5 mortality occurring in east Asia (67·7% decrease); the largest increases in mortality for those aged 5-14 years, 25-29 years, and 30-39 years occurring in high-income North America (11·5%, 31·7%, and 49·9%, respectively); and the largest increases in mortality for those aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years occurring in Eastern Europe (53·9% and 40·1%, respectively). We also identified higher than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 5-14 years (87·3% higher in GBD 2023 than GBD 2021 on average across countries and territories over the 1950-2021 period) and for females aged 15-29 years (61·2% higher), as well as lower than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 50 years and older (13·2% lower), reflecting advances in our modelling approach. Global life expectancy followed three distinct trends over the study period. First, between 1950 and 2019, there were considerable improvements, from 51·2 (50·6-51·7) years for females and 47·9 (47·4-48·4) years for males in 1950 to 76·3 (76·2-76·4) years for females and 71·4 (71·3-71·5) years for males in 2019. Second, this period was followed by a decrease in life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to 74·7 (74·6-74·8) years for females and 69·3 (69·2-69·4) years for males in 2021. Finally, the world experienced a period of post-pandemic recovery in 2022 and 2023, wherein life expectancy generally returned to pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2023 (76·3 [76·0-76·6] years for females and 71·5 [71·2-71·8] years for males). 194 (95·1%) of 204 countries and territories experienced at least partial post-pandemic recovery in age-standardised mortality rates by 2023, with 61·8% (126 of 204) recovering to or falling below pre-pandemic levels. There were several mortality trajectories during and following the pandemic across countries and territories. Long-term mortality trends also varied considerably between age groups and locations, demonstrating the diverse landscape of health outcomes globally. This analysis identified several key differences in mortality trends from previous estimates, including higher rates of adolescent mortality, higher rates of young adult mortality in females, and lower rates of mortality in older age groups in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight stark differences across countries and territories in the timing and scale of changes in all-cause mortality trends during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-23). Our estimates of evolving trends in mortality and life expectancy across locations, ages, sexes, and SDI levels in recent years as well as over the entire 1950-2023 study period provide crucial information for governments, policy makers, and the public to ensure that health-care systems, economies, and societies are prepared to address the world's health needs, particularly in populations with higher rates of mortality than previously known. The estimates from this study provide a robust framework for GBD and a valuable foundation for policy development, implementation, and evaluation around the world.

Of the more than 310 000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which were new to this estimation round), more than 120 000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden and 59 000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific time trends over the 2010-23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates per 100 000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution. Total numbers of global DALYs grew 6·1% (95% UI 4·0-8·1), from 2·64 billion (2·46-2·86) in 2010 to 2·80 billion (2·57-3·08) in 2023, but age-standardised DALY rates, which account for population growth and ageing, decreased by 12·6% (11·0-14·1), revealing large long-term health improvements. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1·45 billion (1·31-1·61) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1·80 billion (1·63-2·03) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4·1% (1·9-6·3) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90·2 million [75·2-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62·8% [34·0-107·5]), depressive disorders (26·3% [11·6-42·9]), and diabetes (14·9% [7·5-25·6]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25·8% (22·6-28·7) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49·1% (32·7-61·0) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42·9% (38·0-48·0) for HIV/AIDS, and 42·2% (23·6-56·6) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16·5% (10·6-22·0) and 24·8% (7·4-36·7), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15·6% (10·7-19·8) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1·27 billion [1·18-1·38]) of the roughly 2·80 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8·4% (6·9-10·0) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30·7% (24·8-37·3); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6·7% (2·0-11·0) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54·4% (38·7-65·3) for unsafe sanitation, 50·5% (33·3-63·1) for unsafe water source, and 45·2% (25·6-72·0) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44·9% (37·3-53·5) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10·5% [0·1 to 20·9]), drug use (8·4% [2·6 to 15·3]), and high FPG (6·2% [-2·7 to 15·6]; non-significant). Our findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage.

"PubMed","Comparative Evaluation of Pain Control Using 4% Articaine Buccal Infiltration and 2% Lignocaine Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block for Pulpectomy in Primary Mandibular Second Molars in the Children of Age-group 6-10 Years: A Split-mouth Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.","2025","This study aims to evaluate pain control using 4% articaine buccal infiltration and 2% lignocaine inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) for pulpectomy in primary mandibular second molars in children of age category of 6-10 years. In pediatric dentistry, one of the most significant aspects of child behavior management is pain control during injecting local anesthesia. This leads to building trust, allaying fear or anxiety, and promoting a positive dental attitude. IANB is the preferred technique for achieving pulpal anesthesia during the treatment of mandibular primary molars. About 2% lignocaine is the most commonly used anesthetic agent in dentistry. Administration of 2% lignocaine using IANB is difficult in pediatric patients, as it may lead to uncooperative behavior in child, whereas administration of 4% articaine through buccal infiltration is comparatively more feasible in child and also reduces the postoperative complications. Hence, this study aims to compare pain control using 2% lignocaine IANB and 4% articaine buccal infiltration. Children between 6 and 10 years were selected for the study. It was split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial. About 40 primary mandibular second molars were randomized from 20 children. Two categories were as follows: (1) category A-4% articaine buccal infiltration was administered and then pulpectomy procedure was performed, and (2) category B-2% lignocaine IANB was administered and then pulpectomy procedure was performed. It indicated that 4% articaine buccal infiltration had a lower mean pain score than 2% lignocaine IANB using Wong-Baker's face pain scale for objective evaluation and comparing subjective mean pain scores using Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) during pulpectomy procedure. (1) Pulpectomy is possible by depositing 4% articaine buccal infiltration. Articaine is an effective local anesthetic and can be used as an alternative to lignocaine nerve block in children. (2) No significant adverse effects were observed after the use of 4% articaine. Articaine is an effective local anesthetic and can be used as an alternative to lignocaine in children. Delivering comfortable anesthesia is essential, as it increases both patient's trust and treatment acceptance while at the same time reducing personal stress level.

"PubMed","Effect of immersive virtual reality on pain in different dental procedures in children: a randomized controlled clinical trial.","2025","Effective pain management techniques are fundamental for enhancing patients' adherence to various pediatric dental procedures. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) on pain perception during dental procedures in children. Children aged between 5 and 12 years were recruited from a pediatric dental clinic. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained from all parents or guardians. The need for different dental procedures was determined for each child based on the outcome of a clinical examination. Some of these procedures require local anesthesia (LA) administration, while others do not. The children were randomly assigned to either a VR or a non-VR group. Three behavioral scales, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, and the ""Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability"" (FLACC) Scale, were used to assess the pain level during dental procedures. A total of 154 children were recruited and evenly divided into VR and non-VR groups (77 each). The results of the study indicated that utilizing VR during dental procedures resulted in a significant reduction in pain perception (p < 0.05) and doubled the level of relaxation experienced by patients (70.31%), irrespective of anesthesia requirements. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the VR and anesthesia groups across all VAS and Wong-Baker FACES variables. This research has confirmed that using virtual reality (VR) as a distraction technique effectively reduces pain during dental procedures for children. VR is a safe, non-invasive, and user-friendly technique that has gained interest as a non-pharmacological option for pain management. As a result, this promising approach has the potential to be used in clinical practice and should be further researched.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

Recently, dentists have explored using gels with vibrating devices under cold temperatures to mask pain. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of intra- and extraoral vibratory systems with conventional local anesthesia (LA) in assessing pain perception and anxiety in children. A total of 120 children, aged 6-10 years, needing dental procedures with LA, were divided into three groups of 40 each. Group I received conventional treatment, while groups II and III were treated with intra- and extraoral vibratory systems, respectively. Anxiety levels were recorded using pulse oximetry, and pain perception was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) and face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability (FLACC) scale. Anxiety levels showed no significant difference between groups, but pain scores measured by VAS were significantly lower in groups II and III. FLACC scores showed no significant differences. Intra- and extraoral vibratory systems can be effective adjuncts to conventional LA techniques. Mamilla SG, Cheruku SR, Mohammad ZU, et al.

"PubMed","Comparative evaluation of 3% plain mepivacaine and 2% lignocaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline in the pediatric population: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial.","2025","Effective local anesthesia is essential in pediatric dentistry, especially during procedures like pulpectomy. While lignocaine with adrenaline is widely used, mepivacaine without a vasoconstrictor offers potential benefits in pediatric patients. This study aimed to compare the hemodynamic responses and pain perception associated with 3% mepivacaine (plain) versus 2% lignocaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline in children undergoing pulpectomy. A randomized, double-blind controlled trial was conducted at the Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry of Dr. R. Ahmed Dental College and Hospital, Kolkata, India. Fifty children aged 6-13 years with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis were randomly assigned to receive either mepivacaine or lignocaine through buccal infiltration. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and intraoperative pain (Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale) were recorded at four time points (preoperatively, 5-, 15-, and 30-min postadministration). Comparisons within the group over different time points were performed using Friedman's test, while intergroup comparisons at each time point were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. All analyses were conducted with the significance level set at 5%. The mepivacaine group showed significantly lower HR at T1 (P < 0.0001) and reduced postoperative pain scores (P = 0.0046). SBP and DBP changes were less pronounced compared to lignocaine, though not statistically significant. Mepivacaine without vasoconstrictor provided effective anesthesia with better hemodynamic stability and pain control, supporting its use as a safe alternative in pediatric endodontics, especially where epinephrine use is undesirable.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

"PubMed","The global, regional, and national burden of cancer, 1990-2023, with forecasts to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","2025","Cancer is a leading cause of death globally. Accurate cancer burden information is crucial for policy planning, but many countries do not have up-to-date cancer surveillance data. To inform global cancer-control efforts, we used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 framework to generate and analyse estimates of cancer burden for 47 cancer types or groupings by age, sex, and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023, cancer burden attributable to selected risk factors from 1990 to 2023, and forecasted cancer burden up to 2050. Cancer estimation in GBD 2023 used data from population-based cancer registration systems, vital registration systems, and verbal autopsies. Cancer mortality was estimated using ensemble models, with incidence informed by mortality estimates and mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Prevalence estimates were generated from modelled survival estimates, then multiplied by disability weights to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the GBD standard life expectancy at the age of death. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We used the GBD 2023 comparative risk assessment framework to estimate cancer burden attributable to 44 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risk factors. To forecast cancer burden from 2024 to 2050, we used the GBD 2023 forecasting framework, which included forecasts of relevant risk factor exposures and used Socio-demographic Index as a covariate for forecasting the proportion of each cancer not affected by these risk factors. Progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4 aim to reduce non-communicable disease mortality by a third between 2015 and 2030 was estimated for cancer. In 2023, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, there were 18·5 million (95% uncertainty interval 16·4 to 20·7) incident cases of cancer and 10·4 million (9·65 to 10·9) deaths, contributing to 271 million (255 to 285) DALYs globally. Of these, 57·9% (56·1 to 59·8) of incident cases and 65·8% (64·3 to 67·6) of cancer deaths occurred in low-income to upper-middle-income countries based on World Bank income group classifications. Cancer was the second leading cause of deaths globally in 2023 after cardiovascular diseases. There were 4·33 million (3·85 to 4·78) risk-attributable cancer deaths globally in 2023, comprising 41·7% (37·8 to 45·4) of all cancer deaths. Risk-attributable cancer deaths increased by 72·3% (57·1 to 86·8) from 1990 to 2023, whereas overall global cancer deaths increased by 74·3% (62·2 to 86·2) over the same period. The reference forecasts (the most likely future) estimate that in 2050 there will be 30·5 million (22·9 to 38·9) cases and 18·6 million (15·6 to 21·5) deaths from cancer globally, 60·7% (41·9 to 80·6) and 74·5% (50·1 to 104·2) increases from 2024, respectively. These forecasted increases in deaths are greater in low-income and middle-income countries (90·6% [61·0 to 127·0]) compared with high-income countries (42·8% [28·3 to 58·6]). Most of these increases are likely due to demographic changes, as age-standardised death rates are forecast to change by -5·6% (-12·8 to 4·6) between 2024 and 2050 globally. Between 2015 and 2030, the probability of dying due to cancer between the ages of 30 years and 70 years was forecasted to have a relative decrease of 6·5% (3·2 to 10·3). Cancer is a major contributor to global disease burden, with increasing numbers of cases and deaths forecasted up to 2050 and a disproportionate growth in burden in countries with scarce resources. The decline in age-standardised mortality rates from cancer is encouraging but insufficient to meet the SDG target set for 2030. Effectively and sustainably addressing cancer burden globally will require comprehensive national and international efforts that consider health systems and context in the development and implementation of cancer-control strategies across the continuum of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

"PubMed","Global, Regional, and National Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors in 204 Countries and Territories, 1990-2023.","2025","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality and are among the foremost causes of disability globally. CVD burden has continued to increase in most countries since 1990, with trends driven by changing exposures to harmful risk factors, population growth, and population aging. We report estimates of global, national, and subnational CVD burden, including 18 subdiseases and 12 associated modifiable risk factors. We analyzed change in CVD burden from 1990 to 2023 and identified drivers of change including population growth, population aging, and risk factor exposure. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2023 study, a multinational collaborative research study, quantified burden due to 375 diseases including CVD burden and identified drivers of change from 1990 to 2023 using all available data and statistical models. GBD 2023 estimated the population-level burden of diseases in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023. CVDs were the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths estimated in the GBD. As of 2023, there were 437 million (95% UI: 401 to 465 million) CVD DALYs globally, a 1.4-fold increase from the number in 1990 of 320 million (292 to 344 million). Ischemic heart disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and hypertensive heart disease were the leading cardiovascular causes of DALYs in 2023 globally. As of 2023, age-standardized CVD DALY rates were highest in low and low-middle Socio-demographic Index (SDI) settings and lowest in high SDI settings. The number of CVD deaths increased globally from 13.1 million (95% UI: 12.2 to 14.0 million) in 1990 to 19.2 million (95% UI: 17.4 to 20.4 million) in 2023. The number of prevalent cases of CVD more than doubled since 1990, with 311 million (95% UI: 294 to 333 million) prevalent cases of CVD in 1990 and 626 million (95% UI: 591 to 672 million) prevalent cases in 2023 globally. A total of 79.6% (95% UI: 75.7% to 82.5%) of CVD burden is attributable to modifiable risk factors 347 million [95% UI: 318 to 373 million] DALYs in 2023). Globally, high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and air pollution were the modifiable risks responsible for most attributable CVD burden in 2023. Since 1990, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors have had mixed effects on CVD burden, with increases in high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, and low physical activity leading to higher burden, while reductions in tobacco usage have mitigated some of these increases. Population growth and population aging were the main drivers of the increasing burden since 1990, adding 128 million (95% UI: 115 to 139 million) and 139 million (95% UI: 126 to 151 million) CVD DALYs to the increase in CVD burden since 1990. CVD remains the leading cause of disease burden and death worldwide with the greatest burden in low, low-middle, and middle SDI regions. Large variation exists in CVD burden even for countries at similar levels of development, a gap explained substantially by known, modifiable risk factors that are inadequately controlled. The decades-long increase in CVD burden was the result of population growth, population aging, and increased exposure to a subset of risk factors led by metabolic risks. Countries will need to adopt effective health system and public health strategies if they are to progress in achieving global goals to reduce the burden of CVD.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","What Factors Affect Safe Bedside Extubation After Mandibular Distraction?","2025","ObjectiveThere is no universal protocol for extubation following mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) surgery in infants with Robin sequence (RS). The aims of this study were to identify the frequency and contributing factors for reintubation after MDO, to help determine the optimal setting for planned extubation.DesignThis is a retrospective observational study of patients with RS managed with MDO during their first year of life from 2013 to 2021.Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome variable was the need for reintubation <24 h after extubation. A secondary outcome was the frequency of oxygen saturation <95% after extubation.ResultsFifty-two subjects were included. Of these, 31 (59.6%) were male, 43 (82.7%) had a cleft palate, 19 (36.5%) were syndromic, and 24 (46.2%) had ≥1 comorbidity. Extubation was at 3.6 ± 2.4 days after surgery and 1 patient (1.9%) required reintubation. Forty-one (78.8%) had ≥1 transient oxygen desaturation managed with supplemental oxygen (n = 25, 61%) or continuous positive airway pressure (n = 16, 39%). Increased risk for postextubation respiratory events was associated with Stickler syndrome (P = .01), musculoskeletal, neurologic, or endocrine comorbidities (P < .001), low birthweight (P = .044), and high preoperative obstructive Apnea-Hypopnea Index (P = .037).Conclusions and RelevanceReintubation was rare and minor postextubation oxygen desaturations, while common, were readily treated utilizing standard intensive care unit protocols. We conclude that most infants with RS can be safely extubated in their care unit following MDO. This minimizes medical resources, decreases hospital charges, and simplifies patient management compared to returning to the operating room for extubation.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

This study aims to develop a preclinical MA model to investigate the dynamic interplay between craniofacial structural defects and neurobehavioral dysfunction. Longitudinal behavioral phenotyping including von Frey filaments test as well as open field and elevated plus maze tests reveals progressive sensory hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors, with computational ethology revealing subtle but consistent alterations in the naturalistic behaviors. Whole-brain activity mapping reveal hyperactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), whereas multi-omics profiling reveal cell type-specific transcriptional changes and synaptic reorganization within this region. Functional investigation including sparse labeling, electrophysiology, western blotting, and chemogenetics demonstrate that the ACC modulation regulated both pain and anxiety. These findings establish a causal association between structural craniofacial defects and maladaptive neural circuit remodeling, with the ACC emerging as a critical therapeutic target. The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how anatomical abnormalities translate into persistent neurological dysfunction and offers new avenues for mechanistically informed intervention.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","Comparative Evaluation of Two Active Distraction Techniques during Intraoral Local Anesthesia Administration among 3-6-year-old Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","2025","A common and inevitable intrusive technique that causes anxiety in people of all ages, but particularly in young ones, is local anesthesia. A variety of behavioral management strategies, including active distraction tactics such as having a communication with the child, deep breathing, Writing In The Air Using Leg (WITAUL), and stress balls, are available to help reduce anxiety brought on by local anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the behavioral management techniques: stress ball and the hands-eyes-mouth distraction technique (HEM-DT). Three groups of 60 preschool children participated in the study: group I (control group: communication), group II (stress ball distraction), and group III (HEM-DT). After applying topical lidocaine gel to the buccal mucosa, local anesthetic (LA) was deposited. The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS) was used to measure dental pain following the administration of local anesthesia, while the Facial Image Scale (FIS) was used to measure anxiety. A pulse oximeter was used to measure the pulse rate. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the groups (p < 0.05). HEM-DT showed significant difference on comparing pre-FIS and post-FIS scores, with a p-value of 0.014. Pulse rate was comparatively lesser in HEM-DT. When comparing WBFPRS between the three groups, HEM-DT exhibited significant difference. HEM-DT technique was found to be better than stress ball technique and communication. The HEM-DT is a useful tool in pediatric dentistry that helps divert a child's attention from the needle and reduce their pain perception during various treatments.

"PubMed","Effectiveness of topical ajwain oil in reducing pain during local anaesthesia administration in paediatric dental patients: A randomized controlled trial.","2025","Needle anxiety is one of the most common barriers to providing stress-free dental care in children.

Topical anaesthetics have long been considered a valuable aid in this regard. Recently, the efficacy of herbal topical anaesthetic agents has been compared with that of conventional sprays and gels. The present study is among the first to evaluate the effectiveness of Trachyspermum ammi (Ajwain) oil as a topical agent for pain control during local anaesthesia administration in paediatric dental patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the analgesic efficacy of Ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi) oil with a conventional 15 % w/w lidocaine topical spray in reducing pain perception during the administration of local anaesthesia in paediatric dental patients. A total of 52 children, aged 6-10 years and meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were randomly divided into two equal groups (Group 1: Ajwain oil; Group 2: topical anaesthetic spray) using the chit method. Pain responses were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Wong-Baker Facial Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS). Independent t-tests revealed statistically significant differences between Group 1 and Group 2 for both VAS and WBFPRS scores, with p values of 0.001 for each scale, indicating a significant reduction in pain perception in the Ajwain oil group. Ajwain oil shows potential as an effective alternative to conventional topical anaesthetic sprays for reducing injection pain in paediatric dental patients.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of lavender-neroli oil aromatherapy in managing dental anxiety and pain in children undergoing inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) anesthesia. Methods. Fifty-four children aged 6-11 years were randomly assigned to either a control group or an aromatherapy group. Children in the control group were asked to wear a regular scented-free nitrous oxide mask. Children in the control group were asked to wear a regular scented-free nitrous oxide mask. Children in the intervention group inhaled lavender-neroli oil via a nitrous oxide nasal mask for 5 min before and during IANB administration. Anxiety and pain levels were assessed pre-and post-treatment using the Facial Image Scale (FIS), Face-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolability (FLACC) scale, and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation). The collected data were statistically analyzed using SPSS software 20. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for analyzing FIS results, and the independent T test and T Paired test were used for analyzing heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation results. Results. Results demonstrated significantly lower anxiety, heart rate, blood pressure, and pain scores in the aromatherapy group compared to the control group (p < 0.05), with no significant change in oxygen saturation. Conclusions. Lavender-neroli aromatherapy is a safe, low-cost, and effective adjunct to reduce anxiety and discomfort during pediatric dental anesthesia.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","Effect of Sweet Aromatherapy on the Injection Pain of Infiltration Anesthesia for Primary Maxillary Molars in Children: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Clinical Trial.","2025","Background: Pain during dental injections can negatively impact children's perception of dental visits. Various methods have been explored to reduce this pain. Aim: This study aimed to assess the effect of sweet aromatherapy on injection pain associated with infiltration anesthesia for primary maxillary molars in 7-9-year-old children. Design: In this randomized, double blind controlled clinical trial, 48 children (7-9 years old) requiring infiltration anesthesia for maxillary molars were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 16 each) (I) control group receiving anesthetic injection in an unscented room; (II) anesthetic injection in a room saturated with 2% sweet vanilla scent, and (III) anesthetic injection simultaneous with exposure to 2% sweet vanilla scent for 30 sec. Subjective pain was measured using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, while objective pain was assessed using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) behavioral scale. Heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) were also recorded as physiological indicators. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: The FLACC scores and HR in the intervention groups was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.05). Regarding SpO2, only the difference between the control and saturated room groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in Wang-Baker score between groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Two percent sweet vanilla scent can be a successful distraction method to reduce injection pain during infiltration anesthesia for maxillary molars in children aged 7-9 years. Further research in different age groups with a larger sample size seems necessary to strengthen the evidence.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

In this retrospective analysis, 172 pneumothorax cases (148 patients aged >12 years, 24 patients aged ≤12 years) with both chest radiographs and confirmatory thoracic CT were included from a tertiary emergency department. Patients were categorized by age and pneumothorax size (small/large). Each radiograph was presented to all three LLMs accompanied by basic symptoms (dyspnea or chest pain), with each model analyzing each image three times. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using overall accuracy (all three responses correct), strict accuracy (≥2 responses correct), and ideal accuracy (≥1 response correct), alongside response consistency assessment using Fleiss' Kappa. In patients older than 12 years, ChatGPT-4o demonstrated the highest overall accuracy (69.6%), followed by Claude 3.5 (64.9%) and Gemini 2.0 (57.4%). Performance was significantly poorer in pediatric patients across all models (20.8%, 12.5%, and 20.8%, respectively). For large pneumothorax in adults, ChatGPT-4o showed significantly higher accuracy compared to small pneumothorax (81.6% vs. 42.2%; p < 0.001). Regarding consistency, Gemini 2.0 demonstrated excellent reliability for large pneumothorax (Kappa = 1.00), while Claude 3.5 showed moderate consistency across both pneumothorax sizes. This study, the first to evaluate these three current multimodal LLMs in pneumothorax identification across different age groups, demonstrates promising results for potential clinical applications, particularly for adult patients with large pneumothorax. However, performance limitations in pediatric cases and with small pneumothoraces highlight the need for further validation before clinical implementation.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

Although lidocaine is the reference standard, articaine has been proposed as a less invasive alternative due to its superior diffusion properties. A randomized, single-blind, noninferiority clinical trial was conducted with 76 children aged 6 through 9 years requiring extraction of maxillary primary molars. Participants were allocated into 2 groups: single buccal infiltration with 4% articaine and conventional buccal and palatal infiltration with 2% lidocaine. The primary outcome was self-reported pain using a visual analog scale (ie, a 10-cm horizontal line where 0 represented no pain and 10 represented the most pain imaginable). Noninferiority was assessed with a predefined margin of 1.5 cm. Negative binomial regression was used to explore predictors of pain. Mean (SD) pain scores were significantly higher in the articaine group (4.18 [3.41] cm) than the lidocaine group (1.68 [2.71] cm; P < .001). The upper limit of the 95% CI (3.90 cm) exceeded the noninferiority margin, precluding confirmation of noninferiority (P = .919). Results of regression analysis showed that articaine was associated with 2.15 times higher pain scores (P = .008) and increased heart rate correlated with increased pain (P = .023). Our findings do not support the use of buccal infiltration with 4% articaine only as a noninferior technique to conventional lidocaine infiltration with palatal injection in pediatric maxillary molar extractions. Buccal infiltration with articaine only may not be sufficient to ensure adequate anesthesia for extraction of maxillary primary molars. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

This information is important because currently, no guidelines exist to define the usage of local anesthetics in dental cases under GA. Methods: This study was designed as a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Intraoperatively, physiologic parameters, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) were observed during points of potential stimulation, and the corresponding time was recorded from the monitor of the operation room. The Aldrete scoring system was then recorded for all the included participants. Results: There were 34 children (55.9% boys, 44.1% girls, age 2-7 years) for whom the dental treatment was done under GA in the study. The mean age was 4.08 ± 1.31 years. ETCO2 was significantly lower in the group that received LA than in those that did not (p  < 0.05). Aldrete's score in the group that received LA was significantly higher than that did not (9 vs. 9.47 ± 0.51, p = 0.002). Conclusion: In conclusion, we found LA provides better intraoperative vital sign stability, particularly regarding heart rate and ETCO2. Also, patients who did not receive LA had statistically significantly higher ETCO2 than those patients who received LA.

This cross-sectional pilot study aimed to use plasma proteomics to identify markers that inform on molecular pathways associated with pain and emotional symptoms in FD/MAS. Seventeen individuals (15 females, 2 males), aged 16 to 63 years, with confirmed diagnoses of monostotic FD, polyostotic FD, or MAS participated in a single study visit conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and Massachusetts General Brigham. During the visit, participants completed validated questionnaires assessing neuropathic pain characteristics, pain interference, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and perceived stress, and provided plasma samples. These samples were analyzed for 57 proteins using Olink proximity extension assay. Associations between protein concentrations and symptom scores were evaluated using Spearman's correlations with false discovery rate correction (|r| > 0.5, p < 0.05). After FDR correction, the concentrations of seven proteins (TNF-α, LTA, CCL19, CSF2, CCL2, CCL4, CCL7) significantly correlated with pain interference, HADS-depression scores, or perceived stress. Four protein concentrations (TNF-α, CCL19, CSF2, CCL7) significantly correlated with multiple clinical measures. This pilot study identified several pain-associated proteins in individuals with FD/MAS, suggesting that proteomic profiling may be a promising approach for discovering pain biomarkers. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to validate these results and investigate whether targeting immune pathways can alleviate pain and improve emotional health in FD/MAS.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

The study subjects were divided into a control group (n=54) and an experimental group (n=54) by retrieving intraoperative cases and postoperative follow-up records. The control group was given general anesthesia through inhalation combined with nasotracheal intubation, whereas the experimental group was given local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine on each treated tooth on the basis of general anesthesia. The basic information, preoperative anesthesia depth, hemodynamic changes during different surgical procedures, postoperative pain, and adverse reactions in the two groups were recorded and analyzed. No statistically significant difference was found in the basic information and preoperative anesthesia depth between the two groups (P>0.05). Among the three procedures (pulpotomy, root canal treatment, and tooth extraction), the three observed indicators in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The proportion of patients in the experimental group who needed to take analgesic measures in accordance with the modified facial pain scale (FPS-R) score was significantly lower than that in the control group at postoperative wakefulness and 2 h after surgery (P<0.05).

"PubMed","Pain experience and behavior management: efficacy of photobiomodulation as an adjunct to local anesthesia in MIH patients-a randomized split-mouth clinical study.","2025","Pain management in children with Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) poses challenges for pediatric dentists. MIH affects the enamel of the first permanent molars and incisors, increasing the risk of cavities, hypersensitivity, and making anesthesia and dental treatments more difficult. Children with MIH often experience dental fear, necessitating effective pain management techniques. Photobiomodulation (PBM) has potential analgesic benefits in dentistry but requires further evaluation for its effectiveness in MIH cases. This study aimed to assess the impact of photobiomodulation on pain control in maxillary permanent molars affected by MIH. In our randomized split-mouth clinical study, 45 participants (25 males, 20 females) aged 7 to 15 years, with both maxillary molars affected by MIH, were assigned to either the intervention group (PBM plus standard anesthesia, n = 45 teeth) or the control group (standard anesthesia alone, n = 45 teeth). PBM parameters included a power of 100 mW, a wavelength of 635 nm, energy of 6 J, fluence of 12 J/cm2, and a duration of 60 s. Pain perception, anesthesia commencement, and its extension time were measured and analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 (p < 0.05). The PBM group reported significantly lower subjective pain (mean VAS 2 [1-5]) compared to the control group (6 [2-8]), p < 0.001. FLACC scale scores were also lower in the intervention group (3 [1-5]) compared to the control group (7 [5-8]), p < 0.001. The PBM group showed a lower heart rate (84.6 bpm ± 6.1) compared to the control (113.2 bpm ± 6.1), p < 0.001. Additionally, the anesthesia developed faster in the PBM group (mean: 3.6 ± 0.9 min) compared to the control (6.1 ± 0.8 min, p < 0.001), and the anesthetic effect persisted longer (70.2 ± 3.9 min vs. 50.7 ± 8.9 min, p < 0.001). Photobiomodulation improves pain management and the effectiveness of local anesthesia in maxillary molars affected by MIH by diminishing pain experience and enhancing anesthesia effects, providing a promising approach for pain control in children.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

This study aimed to clarify how assessment timings have been implemented in existing PICS research through a scoping review, and to explore expert opinions on optimal assessment timing via an online survey. We conducted a scoping review of studies assessing PICS-related outcomes, including physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments, as well as PICS in family members. Studies were retrieved from MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL, and screened by two independent pairs of reviewers. Eligible studies were published between January 2014 and December 2022. Studies lacking a clear description of assessment timing were excluded. We analyzed the reference point used to determine assessment schedules, the assessment time points, and their frequency. Additionally, an online questionnaire was administered to 23 members of the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine PICS committee and working group members to collect expert opinions on these three aspects for clinical research. A total of 657 studies were included. In prior studies, hospital discharge was the most commonly used reference point for determining assessment schedule (240 studies, 40%). However, ICU discharge was identified by experts as the ideal reference point (16 votes, 47%). The most frequently used assessment time points were 3 months (262, 23%), 6 months (212, 19%), and 12 months (206, 18%) post-discharge. Experts most commonly selected the period between 6 and 12 months as the optimal time point for assessment. While single assessments were most common in previous studies (337, 51%), experts considered three assessments to be ideal (12, 44%). This study revealed notable discrepancies between the assessment timing reported in previous studies and the opinions of experts regarding optimal timing.

To avoid the use of monitoring methods more invasive than the dental procedure itself, cardiac output was continuously assessed using FloTrac™ and BioZ.com™ systems. The bispectral index was maintained between 40 and 67 during anesthesia. Although the patient's body surface area (BSA) was 0.5 m2, which is below the validated threshold for both devices, monitoring was cautiously conducted to observe hemodynamic trends. Discrepancies in the cardiac output and index values were observed between the two modalities. Although the absolute values were less reliable owing to the patient's low BSA, hemodynamic stability was maintained by tracking the dynamic changes in cardiac parameters. These observations underscore both the limitations and the potential of noninvasive cardiac monitoring in pediatric patients with Fontan circulation undergoing general anesthesia. Accordingly, future development of monitoring technologies that can accurately measure cardiac output in pediatric patients with BSA < 1 m2 is warranted.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

Objective This study aimed to evaluate children's level of cooperation during dental procedures in relation to their preference for different types of dental injectors. Materials and methods This study involved 150 children randomly assigned into two equal groups using a lottery method. Group A was given a choice between a metal injector and a plastic injector without stickers on it, while Group B chose a metal injector or a plastic injector with stickers around it. Children's preferences were recorded, and their behavior was assessed using the Frankl behavior rating scale during LA administration. Results In Group A, 43 (57.3%) children chose plastic injectors without stickers compared to 32 (42.7%) preferring the metal injector. In Group B, 62 (82.7%) children preferred plastic injectors with stickers, whereas only 13 (17.3%) chose metal injectors. Behavioral assessments revealed that children in Group A who preferred the plastic injector without stickers exhibited more positive behavior (n = 29, 67.5%), whereas those who preferred the metal injector showed more negative behavior (n = 10, 31.3%). In Group B, children who preferred plastic injectors with stickers showed more positive behavior (n = 43, 69.3%) when compared with those who chose metal injectors in the same group. Across all age groups, children showed more positive behavior toward plastic injectors, particularly those with stickers on them. This difference was statistically significant in the 4-6 and 7-10 years groups (p = 0.039 and p = 0.011, respectively). Conclusion The addition of stickers to plastic injectors significantly improved children's comfort and behavior during dental procedures, particularly in younger children. Older children preferred injectors without stickers, suggesting that age-specific designs enhance cooperation levels and reduce dental anxiety.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","A Comparative Study on Pain Perception in Children, After Application of Pre-Cooled and Plain Topical Anaesthetic Gel During Local Anaesthetic Administration-A Parallel Three-Arm Randomised Control Trial.","2025","Background: Effective pain management in children is essential, particularly when administering local anaesthesia. This study was undertaken to compare pain perception in children after application of pre-cooled and plain topical anaesthetic gel during local anaesthetic administration. Methods: A randomised, single-blinded controlled trial was conducted among 51 children between the ages of 6 and 12, visiting the paediatric clinic, Jazan (REC-45/10/1070). Children were allocated into one of the following three groups using a simple randomisation having a 1:1:1 allocation ratio into Group I (n = 17): Plain topical anaesthetic gel, Group II (n = 17): Pre-Cooled topical anaesthetic gel, and Group III (n = 17). An ice pack was applied for a period of 1 min at the injection site. The intensity of pain and the behaviour of the children were assessed using Face, Leg, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC), the Modified Wong-Baker Scale (WBS) and the Frankel Behaviour Rating Scale (FBRS). Results: A significant difference in FBRS scores was observed during anaesthesia, with the highest median score [3 (3,3)] in the pre-cooled topical anaesthetic gel group (p value < 0.001). FLACC scores varied significantly among groups, with the ice pack group [3 (3, 3)] and [4 (4, 5)] showing the highest median score (p value < 0.001). WBS scores also differed significantly between groups (p value < 0.001) with a lower value in the pre-cooled topical gel group [0 (0, 0), 2 (0, 2)]. Conclusions: This study concluded that, the use of a pre-cooled topical anaesthetic gel before LA administration reduced the pain better than that of plain anaesthetic gel and ice pack application at the injection site during infiltration.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF DEXMEDETOMIDINE-KETAMINE COMBINATION VS DEXMEDETOMIDINE ALONE FOR PEDIATRIC DENTAL SEDATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.","2025","Dexmedetomidine (D) and ketamine are widely used for pediatric dental sedation, each presenting unique benefits and potential adverse effects. Combining these agents, referred to as DK, was suggested to provide a balanced approach to pediatric sedation. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DK versus dexmedetomidine alone in pediatric dental procedures. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and CENTRAL, identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DK to D alone. Eligible studies were screened, and data were extracted following PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models through RevMan software. Five studies involving 308 pediatric patients were included. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in onset of sedation time (MD = -0.02 minutes; 95% CI = [-3.27, 3.23]; P = .99; I² = 29%), duration of sedation (MD = -7.39 minutes; 95% CI = [-21.69, 6.91]; P = .31; I² = 95%), or recovery time (MD = 4.71 minutes; 95% CI = [-12.80, 22.23]; P = .60; I² = 92%). Analysis of Anxiety and pain scores favored DK (SMD = -0.67; 95% CI = [-1.20, -0.14]; P = .01; I² = 35%), (MD = -1.11; 95% CI = [-2.04, -0.19]; P = .02; I² = 20%), respectively. Adverse events, including bradycardia, hypotension, and agitation, vomiting, nausea showed no significant differences between groups. The combination of DK does not offer significant advantages over dexmedetomidine alone for pediatric dental sedation. However, DK showed a moderate reduction in anxiety and pain with a favorable safety profile, suggesting it is a viable option in clinical practice.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","Longitudinal transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis of the blood in two astronauts.","2025","The space industry has made significant strides, leading to an era of commercial spaceflight. Meanwhile, understanding molecular responses to spaceflight is crucial for astronauts' safety. To this end, we examined transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in two astronauts' blood samples at three timepoints: two weeks before spaceflight (T0), 24 hours after spaceflight (T2), and three months after spaceflight (T3). Transcriptomic analysis identified two gene clusters with opposing transient expression trends post-flight (T2), normalized at T3: one upregulated and the other downregulated. Mapped immune cell types through the CIBERSORT coupled with the pathway analysis suggested monocytes' role in coordinated cellular response. Epigenetic analysis identified four methylation patterns with transient and persistent changes post-flight, enriched in nervous system development and cell apoptosis pathways. Methylation changes implicated genes associated with bone disorders, including FBLIM1, IHH, and SCAMP2. eQTM analysis suggested a link between RNA transcriptional level and DNA methylation through transcriptional regulator ZNF684. In conclusion, our study revealed significant short-term transcriptional and methylation changes as well as long-term methylation changes.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

The Pubmed, Cinahl, and Scopus databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: cerebral palsy; any type of outcome measure regarding pain and side effects assessment; any type of studies; and English language. RoB2 and Robins-I were applied to assess the risk of bias. Tables and forest plots synthetized the findings. Seventeen reports were included; most regarded pain control, and ten investigated side effects. Three were RCTs, three were controlled, and twelve were observational studies. Several techniques were used, often in combination, such as non-pharmacological approaches (clown care or virtual reality); topical anesthesia with Emla®®, vapocoolant spray, or ice; and light-to-deep sedation with inhaled nitrous oxide, intranasal fentanyl, rectal, enteral, or intravenous midazolam, or intravenous ketamine or propofol. Vomiting and oxygen desaturation were uncommon complications. Conversely, the pooled incidence of other minor side effects was 6.39% (95% CI: 1.47-14.42%) under the random-effects model, with considerable heterogeneity. All the techniques are safe, if administered in an appropriate setting. Deep sedation is more effective in pain control but requires an anesthetist. A combined individualized approach is preferrable.

"PubMed","Comparison of Intraosseous and Conventional Dental Anesthesia in Children-A Scoping Review.","2025","Background/Objectives: The main purpose of the present scoping review was to map and explore the efficacy of computer-controlled intraosseous anesthesia (CCIA) in comparison with conventional dental anesthesia in pediatric dental patients. Secondarily, this study aimed to compare the acceptance and preference factors between CCIA and conventional dental anesthesia in children. Given the limited and heterogeneous nature of the available literature, this review aimed to identify gaps and scope the extent of research conducted in this area, providing a foundation for future, more targeted studies. Methods: The search was conducted in 19 electronic databases, and the appropriate studies were identified according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Only split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trials that reported on the clinical outcomes of CCIA in children were included. Two reviewers worked independently on the screening and selection of the studies. The same two reviewers carried out the data extraction and the risk of bias assessment, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Due to the exploratory nature, this review focused on mapping the characteristics, outcomes, and research trends rather than synthesizing effect sizes. Results: Out of 841 papers, 2 randomized clinical trials were ultimately included in the scoping review. The outcomes were categorized as primary (including results that answered the focus question) and secondary (relating to additional quality characteristics). Regarding the primary outcomes, in both studies, intraosseous anesthesia was efficacious in achieving the adequate level of anesthesia. One of the secondary outcomes was the acceptance and preference of CCIA in comparison with conventional dental anesthesia in children. The limited number and the high risk of bias in existing studies highlight the necessity for more comprehensive and high-quality research. Conclusions: The selected studies support the assertion that CCIA is a promising technique since it results in less pain perception and is preferred by patients compared to conventional local anesthesia. However, the existing literature is limited and at high risk of bias. Thus, further targeted investigations are needed to evaluate and yield more definitive results regarding the superiority of CCIA.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","Swedish dentists' use of pharmacological pain management in children: a survey.","2025","The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore how Swedish General Dental Practitioners (GDPs) and Specialists in Paediatric Dentistry (SPDs) use pharmacological pain management, focusing on local anesthetics (LA) when treating children. 582 GDPs in southern Sweden and 137 SPDs nationwide received a questionnaire with 4 clinical scenarios covering filling therapy and tooth extractions in children. Each scenario had questions about how often the dentist would use LA and topical anesthetics, answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale (Always, Often, Sometimes, Seldom, Never). The overall response rate was 48.0% (243 GDPs and 102 SPDs). Use of LA reported as Always or Often was more common in SPDs than GDPs for filling therapy in primary molars (98.0% vs. 90.9%, p = 0.019) as well as in permanent molars (99.0% vs. 91.7%, p = 0.006). GDPs who reported Always or Often using LA for filling therapy in primary teeth were younger (42.2 years vs. 49.1 years, p = 0.004) and had fewer years of experience as a dentist (14.2 years vs. 19.9 years, p = 0.016) compared with GDPs reporting less frequent use. There was an underuse of LA among GDPs when treating children. The reasons for refraining from LA are not fully understood, but possible contributing factors can be identified within work environment, insufficient undergraduate training and lack of organizational support and guidelines.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","The role of photobiomodulation in minimizing pain during dental injections in adults and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","2025","This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of laser-based photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in reducing pain associated with dental injections. The review addresses the research question: ""What is the effect of PBMT on pain levels during local anesthetic injections in dental patients compared to control interventions?"". A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies included were prospective or retrospective clinical trials involving PBMT for pain control during dental injections. The quality of studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Data were extracted on patient demographics, laser parameters, and pain outcomes. A total of 14 studies were included in this systematic review, with 6 focusing on children and 8 on adults. In children, three studies indicated that PBMT effectively reduced pain, with a significant difference according to the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (WFPRS) but not on the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale. Conversely, three studies found no significant differences between PBMT and topical anesthesia. In adults, five studies demonstrated a pain-reducing effect of PBMT, though one study reported a statistically significant difference that did not achieve clinical significance. The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant overall effect of PBMT on pain reduction in both children and adults (p < 0.05). This systematic review of the literature suggests that PBMT may help reduce discomfort associated with dental injections in both adults and children. Nonetheless, further investigation is warranted to arrive at a more definitive conclusion on this topic.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","Challenges in Management of Compromised First Permanent Molar With Pathologic Perforation and Periapical Lesion in a 10-Year-Old Boy: A Case Report.","2025","First permanent molars play a critical role in mastication, development of occlusion, dentoalveolar growth and maintenance of dentofacial and skeletal harmony. The first permanent molar is the most caries-prone tooth in the permanent dentition due to its early exposure to the oral environment. Additionally, it takes the longest time to develop from its intrauterine formation to eruption in the oral cavity making it particularly susceptible to hypoplastic changes during development. It has been frequently observed that the age of the child, stage of growth and development, incomplete root formation, limited working area in pediatric patients, behavioural changes, and delayed reporting to the dental clinic complicate the management and affect the long-term prognosis of the molar. Management of compromised first permanent molars (cFPM) in pediatric patients presents several challenges, including behavioural issues, limited cooperation, incomplete root formation, restricted working space, and delayed presentation to dental clinics. These factors, along with difficulties in achieving effective local anesthesia, poor saliva control, and the rapid progression of carious lesions, further complicate treatment and affect the long-term prognosis. The present paper describes the management of compromised first permanent molar in a 10-year-old boy with carious and pathologic furcation involvement and compromised periodontal prognosis using Triple antibiotic paste, Tricalcium silicate cement, intra-operative and post-operative challenges during its management. At follow-up, the tooth was evaluated clinically for the presence of pain, swelling, and difficulty in mastication. Radiographic assessment was performed over a specified time period to monitor the resolution of the periapical lesion and to confirm signs of bone healing and re-establishment of the lamina dura.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"

Following the infiltration technique of LA administration using 2% lignocaine solution with 1:80,000 adrenaline, swelling appeared in the right infraorbital region almost immediately. The swelling resulted from inadvertent deposition of the anesthetic in the infraorbital area due to excessive needle penetration, which occurred as the child became uncooperative during the injection. The patient was prescribed analgesic eye drops and a topical ophthalmic ointment by the ophthalmologist, and the symptoms started subsiding within four hours.

"PubMed","Pain Management and Parafunctional Activity Secondary to Local Anesthesia in Children 4-12 Years Old-A Retrospective Study.","2025","Objective: Successful local anesthesia reduces patient pain and anxiety, facilitates the procedure, and enhances overall comfort; however, in children, it may also increase the risk of parafunctional activities in anesthetized areas. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the factors influencing the risk of self-inflicted injuries. Methods: A study was conducted from January to December 2023 using the records of 4285 pediatric patients aged 4-12 years who underwent dental treatment under local anesthesia. Among 1161 cases at Poznan University (Poland), 73 (6.3%) of self-inflicted injuries were reported. At Rome University (Italy), 823 cases were reviewed, with 522 involving local anesthesia and 23 cases (4.4%) of trauma. Results: The overall prevalence of trauma following local anesthesia was 5.9%, indicating significant clinical concern. The lips were the most commonly affected (69.9%), followed by the cheeks (15.1%) and tongue (15.1%). The study confirmed a positive correlation between younger age and higher trauma incidence, with no significant differences in sex or ethnicity. Longer anesthesia duration and higher anesthetic doses were associated with increased lesion severity. The type of anesthetic also played a role, with articaine showing a higher risk compared to lidocaine. Furthermore, the type of injection influenced trauma incidence, due to the distribution of numbness and exploratory behaviors. Conclusions: Local anesthesia remains an indispensable tool in pain management in pediatric dentistry. However, the risk of self-inflicted injuries is not limited to the youngest patient. Proper education on post-anesthetic care is essential for minimizing complications and ensuring safe and effective dental treatment.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:20.384273"
"PubMed","Melatonin versus midazolam in the premedication of anxious children attending for elective surgery under general anaesthesia: the MAGIC non-inferiority RCT.","2025","Anxiety in children prior to general anaesthesia is common, with up to half displaying distress. Anxiety and distress may lead to unsuccessful anaesthesia, together with greater postoperative pain, agitation and behavioural changes after surgery including sleep disturbances. Midazolam is the current standard premedication; however, it has adverse effects such as the potential for respiratory suppression and unpredictable effects which may result in agitation rather than anxiolysis. Melatonin is an alternative preoperative anxiolytic; however, previous trials have delivered conflicting results. The aim of this non-inferiority trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin compared to midazolam in reducing anxiety in children undergoing general anaesthesia. We undertook a randomised-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, non-inferiority trial in 20 United Kingdom National Health Service trusts, with an embedded qualitative study and health economic evaluation. Anxious children having day case elective surgery under general anaesthesia were randomly assigned to either control (standard of care) group: midazolam; or intervention group: melatonin. The primary outcome was preoperative distress (non-inferiority hypothesis) as assessed by modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale Short Form. Secondary outcomes included safety and efficacy objectives. Analyses were by intention to treat, with an additional per-protocol analysis. The sample size of the trial was 624 children. The trial was stopped early due to recruitment futility. Between 30 July 2019 and 9 November 2022, 110 children were recruited; 55 allocated to midazolam and 55 allocated to melatonin. Pre-planned analyses showed an adjusted mean difference of 13.1 (95% confidence interval 3.7 to 22.4) for the intention-to-treat population and 12.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 22.6) for the per-protocol population, in favour of midazolam. In both analyses, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval exceeds the predefined margin of 4.3; therefore, melatonin is not non-inferior to midazolam. The lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals excludes zero and thus melatonin is inferior to midazolam; the difference found is considered to be clinically meaningful. Adverse events in the midazolam arm (26%) were slightly higher than melatonin (18%); there were no serious adverse events in either arm. Challenges to recruitment included study-related factors (eligibility criteria and trial design), participant factors (caregiver stress on the day of treatment) and practitioner factors (valuing predictability). In terms of acceptability, preferences of the anaesthetist, patient and caregiver factors and medication side effects profile were influential and suggest the choice of preoperative anxiolytic is more complex than previously described. On average, costs over the 14 days post surgery were lower for those who received melatonin (-£46.20, 95% confidence interval -£166.14 to £66.74) with a mean incremental difference in procedure success of -0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.08 to 0.004), although there was uncertainty around the results. In children with preoperative anxiety, midazolam is more effective than melatonin at reducing preoperative anxiety prior to general anaesthesia, although the early termination of the trial increases the likelihood of bias. The trial was prematurely terminated due to recruitment futility. Despite this, a clinically meaningful and statistically significant finding was observed about the primary outcome. There remains a need to develop or repurpose another drug with a more favourable side effects profile to midazolam.

To assess VR's impact on anxiety in children (6-12 years) during dental treatments with local anesthesia. In this clinical trial, we assessed anxiety levels in children (6-12 years) undergoing local anesthetic dental procedures using VR animation. Initially, we utilized the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED) questionnaire for patient selection, in which 44 children were recruited, but eight were excluded, leaving 36 participants who were randomly assigned to either a VR group or a control group with no VR (18 participants each). Anxiety was measured using the MCDAS(f) questionnaire, along with heart rate and oxygen saturation. The results demonstrated that VR significantly reduced anxiety, as reflected in lower MCDAS(f) scores. Moreover, heart rate reductions were notably greater in the VR group compared to the control group (p < 0.001 for both measures), indicating a clear decrease in anxiety. VR shows promise for reducing dental anxiety and improving treatment outcomes, though additional research is needed to assess its long-term effects. The incorporation of VR in routine pediatric dental care may improve child cooperation and reduce reliance on pharmacological sedation.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

The cavity preparation time was on average 2.5 times longer when the Er:YAG laser was used compared to the conventional method. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the Er:YAG laser in hard tissue preparation of deciduous teeth with a pulse energy of 230 mJ for enamel preparation, mainly on occlusal and proximal surfaces, and with a pulse energy of 120 mJ and 150 mJ for dentin preparation. Optimum operating frequencies were 10 Hz and 20 Hz with corresponding water consumption. The level of discomfort among the laser-treated patients indicated 0 based on VAS, meaning no pain. Among patients treated with the traditional method, the pain level averaged 5.27. The use of the Er:YAG laser offers substantial advancements in comparison to traditional treatment with dental turbines by enhancing the overall comfort during caries therapy in children. It fosters better patient cooperation and reduces the need for intraoperative anesthetics due to its minimally invasive nature and the fact that it is a relatively quiet operation. This approach minimizes anxiety and discomfort often associated with dental procedures, making them more amenable to children.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Hemodynamic Response to Tracheal Intubation Using Indirect and Direct Laryngoscopes in Pediatric Patients: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.","2025","Purpose: Hemodynamic response, particularly increased heart rate (HR) and blood pressure, can occur during tracheal intubation and is an adverse event to be avoided. The aim of this study was to use a network meta-analysis (NMA) to develop a ranking of hemodynamic responses (HR and mean blood pressure, MBP) after intubation of indirect and direct laryngoscopes in pediatric patients. Method: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had a prospective randomized design, compared hemodynamic response (HR and MBP) to tracheal intubation between indirect and/or direct laryngoscopes, and were conducted in pediatric patients. The pooled difference between each intubation device's intubation time is expressed as a weighted mean difference (WMD) of a 95% confidence interval (CI). The intubation time of the device was evaluated using P-scores calculated from the network point estimates and standard errors. A random-effects model was used when pooling effect sizes. We also analyzed intubation time as a related factor to hemodynamic responses. Results: From the electronic databases, we selected 16 trials for review. In a Macintosh-referenced analysis, Airtraq suppressed an increase of HR and MBP during tracheal intubation in pediatric patients significantly more than a Macintosh laryngoscope. (HR; WMD = -16.7, 95%CI -22.5 to -10.9, MBP; WMD = -8.57, 95%CI -10.9 to -6.27). Airtraq also topped the HR and MBP P-score rankings. The results of this study showed similar laryngoscopes in the top five rankings of P-scores (Airtraq, Coopdech video laryngoscope, Miller, C-MAC, Wis-Hipple) for HR and intubation time. Conclusions: We applied a network meta-analysis to create a consistent ranking of intubation devices that prevent hemodynamic changes during tracheal intubation in pediatric patients. In this NMA, Airtraq proved to be the best laryngoscope for preventing hemodynamic responses during tracheal intubation in pediatric patients. In the analysis of intubation time, Airtraq showed the shortest intubation time.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

"PubMed","Effectiveness of origami and puzzle game in alleviating dental anxiety and pain perception during local anesthesia administration in children: a randomized clinical trial.","2025","Children experience anxiety in unfamiliar dental environments, impacting their behavior and impeding dental treatment. Local anesthetic infiltration (LA) induces anxiety in children. Distraction is recommended to alleviate the pain and anxiety associated with LA administration. Origami and puzzle games are promising, economical, nonpharmacological techniques to minimize dental anxiety and can enhance intellectual and cognitive development. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of origami and puzzle games as distraction techniques for reducing dental anxiety and pain during local anesthesia infiltration in children aged 5-10 years during local anesthesia infiltration. Fifty-two healthy children, aged 5-10 years, undergoing dental procedures requiring local anesthesia were chosen and divided into two groups. Each group comprised 26 children as determined by simple randomization. Group I: Puzzle game group; Group II: Origami group. In both groups, a physiological measure (pulse rate by pulse oximeter) was measured prior to, during, and following LA administration, while the face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability (FLACC) scale was used to record anxiety levels before and after the intervention. The FLACC Scale, an objective measure, was used to record pain perception during LA administration, whereas the faces pain scale, a subjective measure, was used to record pain perception following LA administration. This was followed by the needful treatment. Pulse rates were compared between the two groups using independent and paired t-tests for inter-and intragroup assessments, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze anxiety and pain scores. Intragroup comparisons of pulse rates before, during, and after LA administration were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Inter-group comparison of pulse rates was also statistically significant during LA administration (P = 0.04); however, there was no significant difference before intervention and after LA administration. However, after the intervention, the mean anxiety scores were significantly reduced in the puzzle game group (P = 0.004). The mean pain scores of the FLACC and Faces Pain Scale-Revised were lower (P < 0.001) in the puzzle game group than in the origami group.

Palatal injections, which are routinely used to extract deciduous molars, may be poorly tolerated by pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pain acceptance and anesthetic efficacy of the Comfort-In needle-free injection compared with the traditional injection method in upper deciduous molars requiring extraction. Patients between the ages of 4 and 10 years who were admitted to our clinic and required extraction of their maxillary deciduous molars under local anesthesia were included in our study. Infiltration anesthesia with a conventional dental injector was applied to one of the symmetrical teeth, and a Comfort-in jet injection system was applied to the other. The Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C) anxiety scale was administered to children. The Wong-Baker Pain Rating Scale (WBPRS) and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scales were applied to the children during the injection. The physiological parameters of the children were evaluated using pulse oximetry. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS V23 software (SPSS Inc., IBM Co., Somers, NY, USA). The significance level was set at P < 0.050. No significant difference was observed between Comfort-In jet injection and conventional dental anesthesia in terms of Frankl scores (P = 0.180), pulse rate (P = 0.569), oxygen saturation (P = 0.615), and FLACC total values (P = 0.082). IDAF-4C anxiety levels were low in most of the included children. The categorical distribution of the WBPRS showed a statistically significant difference according to the method used (P = 0.022). We concluded that the Comfort-In jet injection system is as effective as the gold standard of infiltration anesthesia with a conventional dental syringe and that the Comfort-In jet injection system is acceptable to patients in the postoperative period. Needle-free jet injection is a promising alternative to palatal needle injection for palatal infiltration anesthesia in the maxillary first molars.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

"PubMed","Efficacy of virtual reality hypnosis versus conscious sedation with nitrous oxide in the management of dental anxiety in pediatric dentistry: protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial.","2025","Dental anxiety is defined as a persistent and excessive fear of dental treatment. It often leads to interruptions during procedures and, frequently, avoidance of dental care. For patients over the age of 7, nitrous oxide-oxygen inhaled sedation (NOIS) represents one of the most effective and well-established pharmacological approaches to reducing anxiety and pain during dental treatment. Meanwhile, medical hypnosis offers an interesting non-pharmacological alternative by inducing a hypnotic state, potentially serving as a means of sedation to alleviate anxiety or pain. The advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology makes medical hypnosis more accessible to dental practitioners, yielding promising outcomes. To our knowledge, no clinical trial has evaluated the efficacy of medical hypnosis associated with 3D immersive virtual reality devices for pediatric dental procedures. This prospective, controlled, single-blind clinical study including anxious patients aged 7 to 10 years old aims to demonstrate non-inferiority of virtual reality approach. Using a split-mouth design, each patient will attend two separate visits for two comparable conservative dental procedures. At the first procedure, they will randomly be assigned to receive either hypnosis via VR or NOIS. The alternative method will be administered during the second visit. The primary outcome is the sedation success based on the completion of the dental procedure. A score of 3 or higher on the Modified Venham Scale noted more than twice ends the session and qualifies as a sedation failure. The secondary outcomes involve assessing children's tolerance and the temperament influence on sedation success. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a novel non-pharmacological sedation for the management of anxious children in a dental setting. The results may help practitioners choose the appropriate anxiolytic therapeutic option, based on different psychometric and temperament parameters. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05167331.

It was a single-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled trial with three arms. Forty-five specimens were assigned randomly to three groups: Group 1: Chemomechanical caries removal (CMCR) utilizing Carisolv. Group 2: CMCR utilizing BRIX3000. Group 3: Control group, caries excavation utilizing conventional rotary-mechanical method. Lesions reaching the middle or inner third of the dentine (D2/3) were observed in immature mandibular PFMs with no pulpal and/or periodontal issues included. The efficacy of caries removal was considered the primary outcome measure. It was recorded using the Ericson et al. scale by visual-tactile examination and the caries detector, which includes five levels to rate the amount of carious dentin remaining. The secondary outcome measures were subjective and objective pain assessment and the requirement of local anesthesia. Continuous and categorical data were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests, respectively. A significance level of p < 0.05 was adjusted. All conventional-method cases (100%) and the majority of Carisolv and BRIX3000 cases (80%) showed complete caries removal and a mean score of (0.27 ± 0.59) and (0.20 ± 0.41) (p = 0.185), respectively.

Both groups received standardized midazolam-propofol sedation and perioperative monitoring. Primary outcomes encompassed oxygen saturation (SpO2), adverse events (aspiration, choking, mucosal bleeding), sedation efficacy, and surgeon satisfaction. The NPA group demonstrated superior SpO2 maintenance at key procedural stages (p < 0.05), with a 78% reduction in hypoxemia episodes compared to controls. Notably, aspiration and choking incidents decreased significantly (p < 0.05), yielding a fourfold lower overall adverse event rate (6.67% vs 30.00%, p = 0.001). Sedation quality metrics revealed enhanced behavioral cooperation (p < 0.001) and optimal sedation depth (Ramsay scores: p < 0.001) in the NPA cohort, though pain perception remained comparable between groups (p > 0.05). Surgeons reported 93.33% satisfaction with NPA-assisted cases versus 33.33% with conventional methods (p < 0.001), correlating with fewer procedural interruptions. These findings establish NPA as a clinically superior modality for pediatric dental sedation, offering dual benefits of improved oxygenation stability and procedural workflow efficiency.

Methods: The randomized split-mouth study included 30 patients (17 boys, 13 girls) aged 8.22 ± 1.8 years. The application of atomized lidocaine spray or cream was randomly used in the maxillary second premolar region. The parameters were measured prior to and following each needle insertion after being applied for 10, 30, 60, and 120 sec. Paired t-test and independent t-test were used for statistic analyses. Results: Compared with the first applications (10 s), atomized lidocaine and EMLA cream applications significantly decreased scores of VAS at the 30 and 120 s applications, respectively. Despite atomized lidocaine showing an early effect compared with EMLA, there were no significant differences in VAS scores between the atomized lidocaine and EMLA cream at the 60 and 120 s measurements. Although HR significantly increased at first anesthetic administration with the atomized lidocaine spray, HR significantly decreased at 30 and 120 s administrations. Conclusions: Atomized 10% lidocaine-based topical anesthetics significantly reduced pain more rapidly and better than EMLA from needle pricks in the buccal mucosa. Therefore, atomized lidocaine topical anesthesia could be used as a substitute for EMLA cream prior to buccal anesthetic administration. On the other hand, further comprehensive studies are required to explore the effects of several doses of atomized lidocaine in various areas of the oral cavity.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world.

This study included 63 children aged 6-8 years who required pulpotomy and were divided into three groups: tell-show-do (TSD; Group 1), TSD with video modeling (Group 2), and TSD with mobile phone application (Group 3). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), and hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SPO2) of the participants were recorded before the procedure, after local anesthesia, after pulpotomy, and after the end of the procedure. Faces Version of the Modified Child Dental Anxiety (MCDASf), Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS), and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) pain scales were applied. Chi-squared test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman's test, and repeated measurement analysis statistical tests were used. No significant difference was found between the steps in terms of BP, HR, and SPO2 within the groups (p > 0.05). When comparing the groups, there were significant differences in SBP (p = 0.040) and DBP (p = 0.027) measured at the beginning and end of the procedure, and between MCDASf (p = 0.041) and WBFPRS (p = 0.013) scores. These values ​​were lower in Group 3. Dental anxiety and pain perception scores were lowest when using TSD with mobile phone application (Group 3). In line with developing technology, the use of mobile phone applications in pediatric dentistry can contribute to more harmonious treatment management in children.

"PubMed","Targeting C1q prevents microglia-mediated synaptic removal in neuropathic pain.","2025","Activation of spinal microglia following peripheral nerve injury is a central component of neuropathic pain pathology. While the contributions of microglia-mediated immune and neurotrophic signalling have been well-characterized, the phagocytic and synaptic pruning roles of microglia in neuropathic pain remain less understood. Here, we show that peripheral nerve injury induces microglial engulfment of dorsal horn synapses, leading to a preferential loss of inhibitory synapses and a shift in the balance between inhibitory and excitatory synapse density. This synapse removal is dependent on the microglial complement-mediated synapse pruning pathway, as mice deficient in complement C3 and C4 do not exhibit synapse elimination. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the complement protein C1q prevents dorsal horn inhibitory synapse loss and attenuates neuropathic pain. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the complement pathway promotes persistent pain hypersensitivity via microglia-mediated engulfment of dorsal horn synapses in the spinal cord, revealing C1q as a therapeutic target in neuropathic pain.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Use of Virtual Reality in the Pediatric Perioperative Setting and for Induction of Anesthesia: Mixed Methods Pilot Feasibility Study.","2025","Children commonly experience high levels of anxiety prior to surgery. This distress is associated with postoperative maladaptive behaviors. Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative tool for reducing anxiety and pain during various medical procedures. Previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing children's anxiety in the preoperative waiting room or during induction. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of VR distraction throughout the perioperative period, from the waiting room until the induction of general anesthesia (GA). Secondary aims were to assess its clinical utility, tolerability, and initial clinical efficacy. A mixed methods, concurrent triangulation feasibility trial was piloted at the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Canada. Participants played an interactive VR game throughout the perioperative period, starting from the waiting room until induction. Feasibility was examined with the duration of the VR intervention, recording the number of interruptions, and taking field notes. Clinical utility was assessed using a perception questionnaire. Tolerability was evaluated by the Child Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (CSSQ). Initial clinical efficacy was assessed by the Faces Pain Scale-Revised, Faces Anxiety Scale, Graphic Rating Scale for multidimensional pain, the Induction Compliance Checklist, and the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale. Quantitative data were supported with field notes and semistructured interviews with patients and parents. Quantitative and qualitative themes were compared via the triangulation protocol to produce final themes. A total of 39 patients, with a mean age of 11.9 (SD 2.8) years, undergoing elective surgery under GA participated in the study. Stakeholders, including patients, parents, and health care providers, were receptive and willing to adapt to VR. Of the 39 patients, 19 (49%) continued to use VR during transportation and 6 (15%) were induced with VR. Barriers to feasibility included (1) interruptions to VR in 92% (36/39) of patients by health care professionals, (2) unpredictable surgery delays prolonging the duration of the VR intervention (mean 23.1, SD 24.4 minutes; range 5-150 minutes), and (3) discontinuation of VR before induction due to mask seal (n=3) and discomfort with supine positioning (n=2). Patients were generally satisfied with VR, deemed it acceptable and easy to use, and would recommend it to others. VR was tolerable with no self-reported simulator sickness (CSSQ: mean 0.01, SD 0.1). The mean Faces Anxiety Score was 1.5 (SD 1.1) at baseline and 0.7 (SD 0.9) during VR. While VR demonstrated good clinical utility and was well tolerated in the broad perioperative setting, this study highlighted important feasibility barriers in the waiting room and especially during induction of anesthesia, both at the organizational and technical levels. This study highlights several considerations that should be carefully addressed for the successful implementation of perioperative VR.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Interaction of Erdosteine with TrkA Signaling Pathways: Implications for Analgesia.","2025","Thiol-containing drugs may interact with a region of tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), potentially inhibiting its activation by nerve growth factor (NGF). This action has been linked to potential analgesic activities. Here, we describe the ability of erdosteine, a thiolic compound classified as a mucolytic agent, to bind to the TrkA receptor sequence in silico and its in vitro effects on TrkA activation induced by NGF in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that erdosteine and its metabolite, Met-1, bind to the TrkA receptor pocket, involving the primary TrkA residues Glu331, Arg347, His298, and His297. Furthermore, Met-1 has the ability to reduce the disulfide bridge between Cys300 and Cys345 of TrkA. In vitro measurement of TrkA autophosphorylation following NGF activation confirmed that erdosteine and Met-1 interfere with NGF-induced TrkA activation, leading to a consequent loss of the molecular recognition and spatial reorganization necessary for the induction of the autophosphorylation process. This effect was inhibited by low millimolar concentrations of the two compounds, reaching a maximal inhibition (around 40%) after 24 h of exposure to 1 mM erdosteine, and then plateauing. These findings suggest that erdosteine can act as a TrkA antagonist, thus indicating that this drug may have potential as an analgesic via a novel non-opioid mechanism of action operating through NGF signaling inhibition at the level of TrkA.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

Randomized controlled trials comparing pain perception associated with CCLAD versus conventional injection methods in children published from January 2015 to November 2024 were included. Comprehensive searches were performed in Embase, Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, limited to articles published in English. From 1253 identified studies, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis revealed that CCLAD significantly reduced pain perception based on the Wong-Baker Pain Rating Scale (WBS) (SMD = -0.98, p = 0.011) and heart rate (HR) measurements (SMD = -0.25, p = 0.013), with high and moderate heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup analysis indicated significant pain reduction with CCLAD compared to conventional Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block (IANB) on WBS, though findings varied across other scales and injection methods, demonstrating some non-significant differences. No significant differences were observed in other pain assessment parameters. The overall risk of bias was low in five studies, with evidence certainty ranging from very low to moderate. CCLAD demonstrates potential as a non-pharmacological tool for reducing injection pain in children, particularly as assessed by WBS and HR. Furthermore, CCLAD significantly reduced pain compared to conventional IANB injections in subgroup analyses. Additional research is necessary to optimize treatment protocols and further evaluate the impact of CCLAD on objective pain measures. This study highlights the benefits of CCLAD in pediatric dentistry, particularly its effectiveness in minimizing pain and stress during local anesthetic injections, especially for IANB procedures. Using CCLAD can enhance patient comfort, improve cooperation, and foster a positive dental experience, thereby supporting better treatment outcomes in pediatric patients requiring precise and low-pain care.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

To identify postoperative pain management issues, we analyzed the anonymous survey online or by mail by neonatologists or head nurses in 89 Japan's neonatal intensive care units (levels III and IV). Although 79 units (88.8%) required recommendation for postoperative pain management, 11 units (12.4%) used a pain scale for pain assessment, 35 units (39.3%) had evaluated and recorded the pain assessment, 27 units (30%) had updated the postoperative pain management plan, less than bedside procedure, and 14 units (15.7%) had made a preoperative pain management plan. Pain management among neonatal nurses and neonatologists and pediatric surgeons and anesthesiologists have been in three units (3.4%) for preoperative, and in six units (6.7%), and postoperative pain management consult was provided in 15 units (16.9%), which means Initiatives at facilities are essential.

"PubMed","Pain and Anxiety Levels During Dental Restorations in Primary Molars: INJEX Needleless System vs Traditional Syringe.","2025","BACKGROUND Fear of discomfort can affect children's behavior. This study aimed to compare pain and anxiety levels of children undergoing dental restoration using a conventional technique and INJEX. MATERIAL AND METHODS A split-mouth, randomized controlled study was conducted on 25 children aged between 7 to 10 years. Children who required restoration were randomly allocated to one of the 2 groups: Group I (traditional system) and Group II (INJEX) [25 teeth in each group]. Following standard behavior guidance, a single operator delivered anesthesia. After 3 minutes, the restoration was performed. Pain intensity was assessed using Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) and Wong-Baker Faces Rating Pain scale (WBS), while child behavior was assessed using the Frankl Behavior Rating scale (FBRS). RESULTS Significant differences (P value <0.001) were observed between the 2 groups when the FLACC scores were analyzed during the administration of local anesthesia. There was a notable difference (P value <0.001) found in the WBS scores before and after injection, among which higher scores [4(2,6)] were observed in the traditional system group. CONCLUSIONS INJEX technique manifested benefits in the form of reduction in pain intensity levels felt by children, and their attitudes remained positive throughout the restorative procedure, which improve the experiences of both the child and the dental practitioner. The INJEX system could be a versatile alternative to the conventional technique. INJEX can be used to reduce preoperative fear and postoperative pain and the amount of anesthesia delivered.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

A split-mouth, parallel arm, Double blinded, randomized clinical trial was conducted on children (12 - 16 yrs) undergoing bilateral orthodontic extractions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TENS or PBST. Subjective and Objective parameters for anxiety and pain were assessed, and evaluated for statistical significance (p < 0.05). In this study with 104 patients (mean age 13.59), the TENS group showed significantly lower mean pain scores (WBPRS) for needle insertion (2.30 ± 2.7) versus PBST (5.03 ± 3.1, p < 0.01), LA administration (2.11 ± 2.8 vs. 4.84 ± 2.7, p < 0.01), and extraction (1.92 ± 2.6 vs. 3.23 ± 5.1, p < 0.01). TENS also led to a faster onset of local anesthesia (96.15 s ± 13.9) compared to PBST (155.38 s ± 91, p < 0.05), indicating enhanced efficacy for pain reduction and anesthesia speed. Physiological parameters like pulse rate and salivary pH also showed significant improvements with TENS. Hence TENS and PBST both came out as effective alternatives for topical anesthesia. Both TENS and PBST proved to be effective alternatives to topical anesthesia, TENS therapy with the Synapse Dental Pain Eraser (DPE) demonstrated greater effectiveness in reducing pain and anxiety, reflecting it as a promising option for pediatric patients.

"PubMed","Analysis of Adverse Events Associated With Dental Local Anaesthetics Using Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System Data.","2025","Local anaesthetics (LAs), almost indispensable aspect of dental practice for pain-free procedures, occasionally leads to worrisome adverse events (AEs). We aimed to compare serious and nonserious AEs of LAs for dental reasons in the US Food and Drug Administration AE Reporting System. We retrospectively analysed dental AE reports associated with LAs in the Food and Drug Administration AE Reporting System database from its inception to April 2024. We described AEs by patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and compared ester and amide LA-associated AEs by their severity. We identified 1956 dental cases with a significant increase of AE reports after 2017. Lidocaine and articaine were the most commonly reported LAs (40.4% and 39.2%, respectively). Serious AEs constituted 46.2%, more commonly in females than males (56.6% vs 43.4%, P < .001) and in those on concomitant medications (70.2% vs 42.2, P < .001). These were also significantly higher in epinephrine-containing LAs (70.1%) than that without (34.2%, P < .01). Ester LAs had increased risk of serious AEs (odds ratios [OR]: 3.86; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.77-5.39), particularly as hospitalization, life-threatening event, or death. The odds of serious AEs were lower with lidocaine (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.48-0.71) and articaine (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.52-0.76). Our study showed higher rate of serious AEs with ester LAs and those with vasoconstrictor-added practices. Besides, serious outcomes appear as more likely in females and those where additional drug use was reported. The integration of clinical evidence with pharmacovigilance data has the potential to influence clinicians' LA preferences in dental practice, enabling more informed and evidence-based decision-making.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Comparison of Bupivacaine Trocar Site Infiltration and Peritoneal Instillation for Postoperative Pain in Pediatric Laparoscopic Surgery.","2025","Background Laparoscopic surgery has become the treatment of choice for pediatric patients due to its numerous advantages over open surgery. However, postoperative pain remains a significant barrier to rapid recovery. The intraperitoneal use of local anesthetics for pain management is underutilized in the pediatric population. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of bupivacaine administered at the trocar site versus in the peritoneal cavity for managing postoperative pain in pediatric laparoscopic surgery. Methodology This quasi-experimental study was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Surgery at the Combined Military Hospital, Lahore. A total of 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery were divided into two groups of 40 each. The W Group received bupivacaine trocar site infiltration, while the P Group received intraperitoneal bupivacaine instillation at the end of surgery. Pain scores were recorded in both groups at one, two, four, six, and eight hours postoperatively. The need for rescue analgesia and the incidence of shoulder pain were also evaluated as secondary outcomes in both groups. Results The mean pain score was 19.15 ± 3.8 in the W group, compared to 17.30 ± 4.0 in the P group, with a calculated p-value of 0.03, indicating a significant difference between the two groups. Similarly, interval pain scores, the need for rescue analgesia, and the incidence of shoulder pain were significantly lower in the P group compared to the W group. Conclusion We concluded that intraperitoneal instillation of bupivacaine is more effective than trocar site infiltration with the same agent in reducing postoperative pain across various pediatric laparoscopic procedures. This approach should be adopted to maximize the benefits of minimally invasive surgery in the pediatric population.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

Intraosseous anesthesia, administered via the QuickSleeper system, has shown promise as an alternative to traditional local anesthesia techniques. A single-blinded split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial took place at the dental hospital at King Saud University with 33 healthy patients (aged 4-9 years), who required pulpotomies and stainless steel crown procedures on two mandibular primary molars, to evaluate the effectiveness of two local anesthetic techniques. Each tooth was randomly assigned to receive 4% articaine either delivered via the intraosseous route using QuickSleeper 5 or buccal infiltration. The effectiveness of the anesthesia was evaluated by the number of injections needed and at various stages using the Sounds, Eyes, and Motor (SEM) scale. Postoperative complications, including pain, swelling, and lip numbness, were assessed through follow-up phone calls with the patients' legal guardians. The techniques demonstrated comparable effectiveness; there were no statistically significant differences in the number of injections and in the SEM scale scores. Minimal postoperative complications were reported: lip biting (two cases) and prolonged numbness (nine cases) were reported only when buccal infiltration was used, and swelling and pain were reported when both techniques were used. Intraosseous anesthesia via the QuickSleeper 5 system is comparable to traditional buccal infiltration anesthesia for pulpotomies and stainless steel crown procedures in pediatric mandibular molars. Intraosseous anesthesia offers the added benefit of reduced soft tissue numbness and associated complications.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

Outcomes were e.g. restoration survival, excavation speed, pulp sensitivity/vitality, need of anesthesia, pain sensation. No time restrictions were applied. Risk of Bias and level of evidence was graded using Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and Grade Profiler. Twenty in vivo studies with at least 2263 teeth being assessed in more than 1090 patients were included. Meta-analysis for comparing laser vs. bur revealed that restoration survival (risk ratio (RR)[95%CI]=1.51 [0.87;2.64, low level of evidence) and pulp vitality (RR[95%CI]=1.46 [0.33;6.46], low level of evidence) was not significantly influenced by the use of a laser. Furthermore, significantly fewer patients required anesthesia (RR[95%CI]=0.29 [0.11;0.75, very low level of evidence) and patients' pain sensation was significantly decreased (RR[95%CI]=0.35 [0.22;0.54], very low level of evidence) when a laser was used for excavation and preparation. In contrast, when using a laser for excavation/preparation significantly more time has to be planed compared to the use of a conventional bur (mean difference [95%CI]=2.23 [1.89;2.57], low level of evidence). Using a laser for excavation/preparation treatment does not affect restoration survival and pulp vitality compared to the use of conventional burs, while the need of anesthesia and patients' pain sensation can be reduced. However, significantly more time must be spent to achieve these benefits. Laser-assisted caries removal reduces the need for anesthesia and minimizes patient discomfort compared to conventional rotary instruments, while restoration survival and pulp vitality are not affected. However, excavation speed remains significantly slower. Furthermore, results should be interpreted with caution considering the low level of the evidence.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"

The effectiveness of breathing exercise, BBPT, and behavior management technique in reducing anxiety levels and pain perception was assessed before intervention, after intervention, during local anesthetic (LA) administration, and after treatment using the animated visual pain rating scale (VPRS), pulse rate, oxygen saturation, Frankl's scale, FLACC (face, legs, activity, cry, consolability) scale, and relaxation measurement scale (RMS). There were no significant differences found between the two intervention groups (group A and group B). Both intervention groups significantly reduced dental pain and anxiety in children. BBPT is found to be a simple relaxation and distraction method, which can be considered fun and enhances rapport between doctor and children during treatment. The use of such a technique to relieve the pain and anxiety associated with even a brief painful procedure should be encouraged. Shrimahalakshmi, Shivanand PB, Nisha M, et al.

"PubMed","Comparative Evaluation of Effectiveness of Benzocaine Gel and Ice for Pain Management in Children during Local Anesthetic Administration by CCLAD: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","2025","Managing dental pain in pediatric patients is crucial for successful treatment and reducing anxiety. Methods such as topical anesthetics, distraction techniques, and computerized systems such as the ""WAND"" help reduce discomfort during local anesthetic administration. However, cryotherapy for precooling injection sites is cost-effective and potentially more effective alternative to traditional topical medications. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of ice and benzocaine gel as topical agents for pain management during local anesthetic administration via a computer-controlled local anesthetic delivery (CCLAD) system. A split-mouth, single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted involving healthy children aged between 5 and 10 years who required maxillary bilateral local anesthesia for dental procedures. The objective pain was measured using the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale during the administration of local anesthetic via CCLAD, with the application of topical agent, ice, and benzocaine gel. Moreover, subjective pain was evaluated using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. The topical ice group showed a lower Wong-Baker Facial Pain Scale score compared to the group using benzocaine gel; however, the observed difference was not statistically significant. Topical ice application showed a lower modified pain scale score compared to the benzocaine gel group; however, the observed difference was not statistically significant. Topical ice shows better results when compared to benzocaine topical anesthetic gel. Topical ice application along with CCLAD is an almost zero-pain injection technique in pediatric dentistry. Pain management during local anesthesia injection is a critical step in gaining initial trust during dental treatment. Precooling the injection site with cryotherapy is beneficial in reducing pain before local anesthesia injection in pediatric patients. Ninawe N, Anija CK.

"PubMed","Evidence-based practice of hypnosis in dentistry: Narrative summary of reviews and meta-analysis.","2025","The purpose of this article is to provide a concise summary of the scientific literature in the form of a narrative review to highlight areas where the use of clinical hypnosis is supported by scientific evidence in dentistry. A literature review was carried out to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles on PubMed, written in French or in English, with time limitation from 2000 to May 2023, and updated in December 2024. Articles had to be systematic reviews or meta-analysis linked with the management of dental anxiety and acute dental pain, as well as chronic orofacial pain. Twelve articles were selected for analysis, with 8 on dental anxiety, 3 on temporomandibular disorders, and 1 on burning mouth syndrome. Several literature reviews and meta-analyses published on the subject support the use of hypnosis in several clinical contexts, including local anesthesia, dental extraction and dental anxiety in adults and children. Evidence is also presented to improve the condition of patients suffering from pain associated with temporomandibular disorders. However, the literature remains somewhat fragmented because of the diversity of hypnosis techniques applied, and the different dental procedures or conditions explored. Hypnosis can have a considerable impact in the management of dental anxiety and acute dental pain. It also seems promising for the management of orofacial pain, but further research would be necessary. This research highlights that the available evidence is sufficient to encourage the integration of evidence-based hypnosis training to improve the management of acute stress and pain in dental practice.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Comparison of Pregabalin and Midazolam as Premedication in Children Undergoing General Anesthesia for Dental Treatment.","2024","Pediatric dentists employ both pharmacological and non-pharmacological behavior control methods. Despite the use of behavioral control techniques, some young children cannot undergo treatment in the office, making sedation or general anesthesia necessary. Premedication drugs can be used before general anesthesia to reduce anxiety, control pain, induce amnesia, prevent nausea, and avert potential complications. The search for the ideal premedication for children is ongoing. This study aims to compare the effects of pregabalin and midazolam (MID) in children undergoing dental treatment under general anesthesia. This prospective, triple-blind study included 64 children aged 2 - 6 years who required dental treatment under general anesthesia. Participants who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. One group of children received pregabalin syrup, while the other group received MID syrup. The comfort of the child during separation from the parents, ease of venous access, and degree of sedation upon entering the operating room were evaluated. Blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels were measured at baseline and every 30 minutes thereafter. Additionally, the duration of the patient's stay in recovery until discharge was recorded and compared between the two groups. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Fisher's exact test, and SPSS version 14 software. No statistically significant differences were found between premedication with MID and pregabalin in terms of anxiety during venous access, parental separation anxiety, restlessness in recovery, duration of recovery stay, or changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen levels between the two groups. However, a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the degree of sedation before entering the operating room. Both pregabalin and MID were effective for premedication in terms of sedation and anxiety reduction, with no significant difference between the two drugs in these outcomes.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Evaluation of a Novel Distraction Method in Paediatric Dental Patients: An Observer-Blinded, Randomised, Parallel-Group, Superiority Clinical Trial.","2025","The study introduces novel camouflage sleeves for the 'Dental Syringe Camouflage Technique' (DSCT) as a distraction tool to reduce dental anxiety and pain in paediatric patients while evaluating its efficacy. To evaluate the efficacy of DSCT using light-/dark-coloured sleeves to reduce needle-associated anxiety and pain in paediatric dental patients. A single-blinded, randomized clinical trial with 76 children aged 6-9 years, divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group was further divided based on sleeve colour. Anxiety was assessed using a self-reported scale, and vital signs were monitored. Local anaesthesia (LA) was administered using conventional dental syringes (CoDSs) or camouflaged dental syringes (CaDSs). Postintervention, self-reported pain was also recorded. Data analysis compared groups and pre- and postintervention observations. A significant reduction in children's self-reported anxiety was observed in the experimental group compared to the control, with no significant differences in perceived pain. Children with lighter sleeves showed a greater decrease in anxiety scores than those with darker ones. Camouflage sleeves for LA syringes reduced anxiety during administration but did not significantly impact reported pain. Lighter sleeves were more effective. No significant changes were observed in pulse rate (PR) or blood pressure (BP) with the use of CaDSs.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Diazepam, Meperidine, and Hydroxyzine as a Moderate Sedation Regimen in Pediatric Dentistry: A Retrospective Study.","2025","Moderate sedation is a behavior guidance technique in pediatric dentistry, and evaluating existing regimens can improve sedation outcomes and safety. To determine if behavior at consult and sedation medication dosages is associated with sedation success and the patient's behavior using diazepam, meperidine, and hydroxyzine (DMH) regimen. A retrospective chart review of 324 patients who underwent 404 oral moderate sedations with (DMH) from April 2017 to June 2022. Sedations were graded as Successful or Unsuccessful and Positive (Frankl F3 or F4) or Negative (Frankl F1 or F2) behavior. Primary variables included Frankl behavior at consult and medication dosages. Logistic regression models were used to determine if these factors were associated with sedation success and behavior while adjusting for other patient and sedation characteristics. DMH yielded mostly successful sedations (89%) and Positive Behavior (Frankl F3 or F4) (72%). Lower Frankl scores at consult (OR: 2.3, p = 0.0140) were associated with increased odds of sedation failure. Increased age (OR: 0.8, p = 0.0047) was associated with decreased odds of failure. Meperidine dose demonstrated a significant association with improved sedation while controlling for age and behavior (p < 0.0001). The (DMH) is an effective moderate sedation regimen. Patient selection is a significant factor in sedation success.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Comparative Evaluation of Alveolar Nerve Block with 2% Lidocaine-Epinephrine and 4% Articaine-Epinephrine Buccal Infiltration in Mandibular Premolar and Molar Region in Children: A Double-Blind, Randomized Trial.","2025","Background/Objectives: Effective pain control in pediatric dentistry combines behavior management, local anesthesia, and follow-up care. This study compared the efficacy of inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) with 2% lidocaine and epinephrine versus buccal infiltration (BI) with 4% articaine and epinephrine in treating primary molars, permanent premolars, and molars in children. Methods: Sixty children aged 5-18 years were randomly assigned to two groups in a double-blind study. One group received 1.7 mL BI with 4% articaine, and the other 1.8 mL IANB with 2% lidocaine for dental treatment. Pain was assessed using the self-reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (W-BFRS), while anesthesia effectiveness and behavior were evaluated using the Frankl Behavior Rating Scale (FBRS) and vitality tests. Results: The articaine group reported significantly lower pain scores on all scales (VAS: 1.23 ± 2.01; FBRS: 0.47 ± 0.57; W-BFRS: 1.33 ± 2.04) than the lidocaine group (VAS: 3.17 ± 1.64; FBRS: 1.26 ± 0.45; W-BFRS: 3.17 ± 1.64). Articaine also outperformed lidocaine in secondary measures, with higher positive responses on the questionnaires (articaine: 8.37 ± 1.61 vs. lidocaine: 5.27 ± 1.41, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Buccal infiltration with 4% articaine is more effective than 2% lidocaine administered via IANB for invasive dental procedures in children, providing superior pain control and positive patient responses.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Perioperative airway management techniques and complications in patients with temporomandibular joint ankylosis: Experience from a tertiary care teaching institute.","2025","Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) ankylosis patients pose serious anesthetic challenges due to difficult airway and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, data are sparse on anesthetic management and perioperative outcomes of such patients. This study aimed to identify the anesthetic and airway management techniques in children and adolescents with TMJ ankylosis and whether the presence of retrognathia and OSA increases the risk of airway-related complications. A retrospective anesthetic chart review of TMJ ankylosis patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery from 2008 to 2018 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in India was performed. Available anesthetic data were tabulated and analyzed. Difficult mask ventilation, use of nasopharyngeal airway (NPA), difficult intubation, desaturation at induction and extubation, maneuvers to open the airway at extubation, and any post-operative anesthetic complications were noted. Three hundred seventy-two children including 85 patients of OSA were available for analysis. All patients with OSA had retrognathia. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB) guided intubation was performed in 362 (97.3%) patients. Desflurane and fentanyl were common anesthetics used for the maintenance of anesthesia. Difficult mask ventilation, use of nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) and requirement of airway maneuvers were more common in OSA patients than in non-OSA patients. Difficult mask ventilation was observed in 18.0% and difficult intubation in 12.9% of patients. Desaturation at induction was noted in 5.1% of patients but none required emergency surgical airway access. Maneuvres to open the airway at extubation were required in 24.5% of patients and the incidence of desaturation at extubation was 7.2%. However, no serious adverse event was noted and only one patient required reintubation. FOB-guided intubation should be considered the technique of choice in TMJ ankylosis patients. In the presence of retrognathia and OSA chance of difficult mask ventilation, requirement of NPA and difficulty in maintaining the airway after extubation increase significantly.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
"PubMed","Complex Odontoma Initially Suspected to be Eruption Sequestrum.","2025","Various pieces of information, including the age of the patient, the site involved, symptoms, intraoral findings, and X-ray findings are necessary in making a clinical diagnosis. This report describes a case in which the initial diagnosis was eruption sequestrum based on clinical information but which was later found to be a complex odontoma based on histopathological findings. The patient was an 8-year-old girl who presented at our hospital with the chief complaint of pain in the right mandibular molar region. The distal aspect of the right mandibular first molar, which had partially erupted, was covered with gingiva and hard tissue which were separated from the tooth itself. X-ray findings showing radiopaque hard tissue at this site indicated a clinical diagnosis of eruption sequestrum. After local infiltration anesthesia, the hard tissue was extracted and a gingivectomy performed. Histopathological examination of the excised material, however, indicated a diagnosis of complex odontoma.","(dental anesthetic OR dental anaesthetic OR dental anesthesia OR dental anaesthesia) AND (paediatric OR pediatric OR child OR children) AND pain","2025-11-06 12:38:22.882397"
